# You're in! Welcome to the New Bing!

Since joining [waitlist](https://www.bing.com/new) on February 11th, I finally received an email today that I can use the new Bing.

I couldn't wait to open Edge Dev and enter CHAT, but I soon found that I couldn't input all the characters normally in the input box. I tried it again in Safari and it worked perfectly, so there is probably something wrong with Edge Dev.

After a few rounds of conversations with the new Bing, it felt like it was a bit lacking in conversational enthusiasm, often asking me to change the subject. Moreover, the prompt “This has been lovely, but you’ve reached your daily limit. Chat again tomorrow?” appeared within a few minutes.

I have to say that a very useful feature of the new Bing is that it can obtain information from the web pages and documents we are reading. I tested it, I opened a local PDF file with Edge Dev, clicked the Discover button to chat, and the new Bing can summarize the main points in this file. In addition, it can also easily generate some text in Discover.

According to my experience, I think the new Bing is really good, and I am very much looking forward to the official version in the future.
