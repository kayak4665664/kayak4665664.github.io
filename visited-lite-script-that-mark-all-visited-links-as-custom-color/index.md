# Visited Lite &amp; Color Links: Mark All Visited Links as Custom Color

[Visited Lite](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/15173-visited-lite) is a userscript to customize the color of visited links, and [Color Links](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/color-links/hiponeioelghhaljfflaaflpccedbdem/related) is a browser extension with similar function.

A few days ago, Microsoft launched new versions of Bing and Edge browsers combined with GPT. I read their introductions on the Internet and felt they were really good. And last year I experienced [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) for the first time, so this time I am looking forward to the new version of Bing and Edge and applied to join the [waitlist](https://www.bing.com/new).


{{&lt; admonition question &gt;}}
In the process of using Bing, I suddenly discovered a problem. In Bing&#39;s search results, the visited links and unvisited links were both purple, it&#39;s difficult to distinguish which links are visited and which are not. I have been using Google before, the unvisited links are blue, and the visited links are purple. I didn&#39;t find the relevant settings in Bing and I didn&#39;t know where the problem was. So I looked for some userscripts or browser extensions to solve this problem.
{{&lt; /admonition &gt;}}

## Visited Lite
I found [Visited Lite](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/15173-visited-lite), which can customize the color of visited links for all websites, not just Bing&#39;s. I installed this userscript in Edge&#39;s [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) extension. [Visited Lite](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/15173-visited-lite) marks all visited links with bold color. However, some web pages may not need this function, and they can be excluded from the [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) extension.

## Color Links
After that, I found [Color Links](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/color-links/hiponeioelghhaljfflaaflpccedbdem/related) in the chrome web store. The main difference from [Visited Lite](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/15173-visited-lite) is that [Color Links](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/color-links/hiponeioelghhaljfflaaflpccedbdem/related) need to manually enable the marking function for each website.
