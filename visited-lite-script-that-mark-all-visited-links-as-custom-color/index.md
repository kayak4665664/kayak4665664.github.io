A few days ago, Microsoft launched new versions of Bing and Edge browsers combined with GPT. I read their introductions on the Internet and felt they're really good. And last year I experienced [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) for the first time, so this time I am looking forward to the new version of Bing and Edge, and applied to join [waitlist](https://www. bing.com/new).

In the process of using Bing, I suddenly discovered a problem. In Bing's search results, the visited links and unvisited links were both purple, it's difficult to distinguish which links are visited and which are not. I have been using Google before, the unvisited links are blue, and the visited links are purple.

I didn't find the relevant settings in Bing and I didn't know where the problem was. So I looked for some userscripts or browser extensions to solve this problem. I found [Visited Lite](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/15173-visited-lite), which can customize the color of visited links for all websites, not just Bing's. I installed this userscript in Edge's [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) extension. [Visited Lite](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/15173-visited-lite) marks all visited links with bold color. However, some web pages may not need this function, and they can be excluded in the [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) extension.
