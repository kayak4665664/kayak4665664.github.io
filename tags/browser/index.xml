    <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/15173-visited-lite" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Visited Lite</a> is a userscript to customize the color of visited links.</p>
<p>A few days ago, Microsoft launched new versions of Bing and Edge browsers combined with GPT. I read their introductions on the Internet and felt they&rsquo;re really good. And last year I experienced <a href="https://chat.openai.com/chat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">ChatGPT</a> for the first time, so this time I am looking forward to the new version of Bing and Edge, and applied to join [waitlist](https://www. bing.com/new).</p>
<p>In the process of using Bing, I suddenly discovered a problem. In Bing&rsquo;s search results, the visited links and unvisited links were both purple, it&rsquo;s difficult to distinguish which links are visited and which are not. I have been using Google before, the unvisited links are blue, and the visited links are purple.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t find the relevant settings in Bing and I didn&rsquo;t know where the problem was. So I looked for some userscripts or browser extensions to solve this problem. I found <a href="https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/15173-visited-lite" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Visited Lite</a>, which can customize the color of visited links for all websites, not just Bing&rsquo;s. I installed this userscript in Edge&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.tampermonkey.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Tampermonkey</a> extension. <a href="https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/15173-visited-lite" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Visited Lite</a> marks all visited links with bold color. However, some web pages may not need this function, and they can be excluded in the <a href="https://www.tampermonkey.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Tampermonkey</a> extension.</p>]]></description>
