      <description>&lt;p&gt;My current glasses were bought before I went to college, and I can&amp;rsquo;t see clearly anymore. I am in Beijing, and I heard that Panjiayuan (Beijing Glasses City) had very cheap glasses, so I went there.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, I went to Pingyao Ancient City. The entire ancient city preserves the original appearance of the Ming and Qing Dynasties. It&amp;rsquo;s very spectacular to gaze into the distance from the city wall. There are many snacks, my favorite is Pingyao beef and wantuo!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
