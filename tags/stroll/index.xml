            </div><p>The first semester at UCAS passed quickly, and I feel that the experience of this semester is very rich.</p>
<p>I arrived in Huaibei Town, Huairou District, Beijing on August 17, 2022. I visited Yanqi Lake in the afternoon. Yanqi Lake is a very big lake. There are many trees🌳 by the lake, many boats🛶 on the lake, and many people by the lake. There is also a trail leading to somewhere on the mountain by the lake. I walked on this road for a long time and felt good. Unfortunately, the road was interrupted due to construction🚧. Later, I learned about this road and the viewing platform of UCAS is connected. I saw a lot of birds🐦 on the mountain by the lake. They flew on the lake and chirped on the trees by the lake.</p>

<p>After staying in a farmhouse inn in the village next to Yanqi Lake for one night, I went to UCAS early the next morning. It rained🌧️ all day, and my clothes and shoes were soaked, but when I first arrived at school, everything felt so fresh and I was in a good mood🙂.</p>

<p>With the nucleic acid test every two days, this semester started. The quality and difficulty of the courses offered by UCAS are indeed higher than those offered by NCUT, and I feel that I have gained more. In addition to class, I often ride a bicycle🚲 around the school to see the scenery of the campus. Because the school is backed by mountains and Yanqi Lake, the ecological environment of the school is very good. There are often little animals🐱, and it is said that there are beasts of prey such as boars🐗 and snakes🐍.</p>

<p>I have to say that UCAS has planted many fruit trees in the mountains. After the autumn harvest, we ate a lot of free fruits.</p>

<p>In the early morning of October 15th, our entire dormitory was suddenly notified to be quarantined on the spot, and each of us was sent a hearty breakfast and a large bucket of water. Before I finished eating, We were notified again that the quarantine is over, which is inexplicable😅.</p>

<p>At the end of November, the school became not so peaceful. As the Omicron epidemic became more serious in winter, many colleges and universities in Beijing began to arrange for students to return home. In the beginning, UCAS still required students to complete all the exams at school, and then finally allowed students to return to their hometowns on November 29. All kinds of gossip spread in the school for a while: some people said that there was a student who tested positive for nucleic acid in the school, and all the students could not go home, and they might be quarantined in the dormitory; someone said that after leaving the school and entering the urban area of Beijing, someone would search the mobile phone at the train station or other places&hellip; It feels a bit panicky.</p>
<p>Since the city where my family is located was under lockdown, I didn&rsquo;t know when it would end, so I decided to stay in school. It is said that if there is an epidemic on campus, the cafeteria may not be able to cook normally, so I quickly stocked up some food. At that time, many express delivery services were interrupted, and JD Express also became very slow.</p>
<p>During those few days, most of the students left the school and went home, and the school was quiet. Around December 5, there was a sudden major change in the epidemic prevention policy, and the nucleic acid test every two days was finally ended. But at this time, infected people began to appear in the school, and I also prepared 2 boxes of compound acetaminophen capsules.</p>
<p>After waking up on the morning of December 19th, I felt my throat was dry and a little sore, and there was a lot of nasal discharge. I must have an infection. That night, my sports watch kept warning me my heart🫀 was beating very fast at around 120BMP. I could hear my heart beating while sitting quietly. I was so scared and I lay down on the bed. My whole body was hot, and my heart rate still couldn&rsquo;t drop. With the sound of my heart beating, I finally fell asleep. Checking the records the next morning, the heart rate slowly dropped to around 90 BMP, which is very abnormal.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know what was wrong with this, since it came out in 2019, I didn&rsquo;t know that the new crown virus could affect the heart. I searched on the Internet, and many people have encountered the same situation as me. It is said that it is viral myocarditis. So I quickly placed an order for coenzyme $Q_{10}$ capsules.</p>
<p>On December 22, I went to pick up an antigen detection reagent, and I was indeed infected with the new coronavirus🦠.</p>
<div align="center">
<a class="lightgallery" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/kayak4665664/My-images/IMG_2066.jpeg" title="Antigen test was positive" data-thumbnail="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/kayak4665664/My-images/IMG_2066.jpeg">
        
    </a>
</div>
<p>After a week, my symptoms gradually disappeared, but I still had some cough and my heart rate was still fast. On December 27, I picked up another antigen test reagent, which was negative this time.</p>
<p>After more than a week, I finished all the exams, my heart rate was still not normal, so I decided to go to Huairou Hospital for a checkup. I had an electrocardiogram, heart color Doppler ultrasound, chest CT scan, and multiple blood tests, and the test results showed no abnormalities. The doctor said that my condition should be the sequelae of the new crown rather than myocarditis, and it would take a long time to recover.</p>
<p>It is already 2023, I just hope that we can resume our life before the epidemic as soon as possible🙏.</p>]]></description>

            </div><p>A few days ago, I went to Pingyao Ancient City. The entire ancient city preserves the original appearance of the Ming and Qing Dynasties. It&rsquo;s very spectacular to gaze into the distance from the city wall. There are many snacks, my favorite is Pingyao beef and wantuo!</p>
