# Pingyao Ancient City


A few days ago, I went to Pingyao Ancient City. The entire ancient city basically preserves the original appearance of the Ming and Qing Dynasties. It's very spectacular to gaze into the distance from the city wall. There are many snacks, my favorite is Pingyao beef and wantuo!

I didn't take any good-looking photos, and here are two I took on the southern city wall.
