# Today's Thesis Proposal


Today I participated in the thesis proposal through the Tencent Meeting.

The original plan was to start at 1:30 p.m. I don't know why we waited until 2 p.m😶. There were 24 students and 3 judges in this thesis proposal this afternoon. I was number 12 and waited until 4 p.m. to finally get my turn. Overall, it went relatively smoothly, but there was a teacher who was studying computer networks coincidentally, and my topic involved a lot of network stuff, so I was questioned closely.

After my turn, because the teacher didn't say we could withdraw, I just continued to stay in the meeting to watch others. An unnamed student was recommended to study at the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences for postgraduate study without examination, his graduation project was in cooperation with Huawei. He said that the results of his graduation project would beat the previous work of his supervisor, and he was determined to submit a paper to the top conference as well👍.

Such excellent classmates inspire me to do my work better, and keep working hard👍.
