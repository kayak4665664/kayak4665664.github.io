# Devtools-Font

I suddenly found that the font family in Chrome Devtools cannot be modified directly the day before yesterday. I checked it and found that I can write an extension to solve this problem.
&lt;!--more--&gt;

I mainly refer to [https://gist.github.com/vbsessa/e337d0add70a71861b8c580d5e16996e](https://gist.github.com/vbsessa/e337d0add70a71861b8c580d5e16996e), but the font in &#34;Sources&#34; does not change according to this tutorial. I made some modifications based on this. Finally, I changed the font to `FiraCode Nerd Font`. I have to say that this font is really good-looking, and there is a ligature effect.
