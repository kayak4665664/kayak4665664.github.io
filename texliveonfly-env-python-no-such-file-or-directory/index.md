# texliveonfly, env: python: No Such File or Directory

{{< admonition failure >}}
Yesterday I used the texliveonfly package and got `env: python: No Such File or Directory` directly.

I tried to execute `python`, and a prompt from Xcode Command Line Tools popped up, saying that I needed to download something, and it downloaded Python3.9, while I already had Python3.8ðŸ™ƒ.

I tried to create a symbolic link with `ln`, but it didn't work.

I thought since texliveonfly was written in Python, I could edit it directly. So I found `/Library/TeX/texbin/texliveonfly` and changed the first line of this file from `#!/usr/bin/env python` to `#!/usr/bin/env python3`, which solved the problem.
