# Turn Idle WeChat Official Account Into a Robot

It only takes 5 minutes to turn the WeChat official account into a robot🤖.
&lt;!--more--&gt;

I registered a WeChat official account before, but it has been idle, so I want to turn it into a robot and play a little role.

## method
1. Use WeChat scan QR code to log in [微信对话开放平台](http://chatbot.weixin.qq.com/)
2. Set the name of the robot on the robot creation page to complete the robot creation
3. Turn on the robot&#39;s &#34;预置技能&#34; as needed, such as English translation, weather, stocks, news, jokes, etc.
4. Bind the WeChat official account in &#34;应用绑定&#34;
5. Publish in &#34;上线发布&#34;

Really simple!
