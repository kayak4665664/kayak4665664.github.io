# Turn Idle WeChat Official Account Into a Robot

It only takes 5 minutes to turn the WeChat official account into a robot🤖.

I registered a WeChat official account before, but it has been idle, so I want to turn it into a robot and play a little role.

## method
1. Use WeChat scan QR code to log in [微信对话开放平台](http://chatbot.weixin.qq.com/)
2. Set the name of the robot on the robot creation page to complete the robot creation
3. Turn on the robot's "预置技能" as needed, such as English translation, weather, stocks, news, jokes, etc.
4. Bind the WeChat official account in "应用绑定"
5. Publish in "上线发布"

Really simple!
