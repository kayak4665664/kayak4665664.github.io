# Springboot-Demo

I chose a Java programming course this semester, and finally completed a project, which is **Springboot-Demo**.

The function of this program is to read data from the `json` file and then display it on the page. In addition to the `Springboot` framework, the front end is still my commonly used `Layui` and `Highcharts`.

I chose this Java course mainly to practice Java&#39;s Web development. I remember when I was a junior, there was a software engineering practice course, and one of the experiments was to make a Web application. At that time, I first came into contact with Web development. I wanted to use Java and `Springboot` to complete it. I found some tutorials on the Internet and felt a little unclear. Then I learned about the `Django` framework of python, and found it easier to understand. Finally, I used `Django` to do that experiment. This time I used `Springboot`, and I feel that it is not much different from `Django`.
