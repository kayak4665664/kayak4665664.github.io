  <description><![CDATA[<p>This week my school started the work on the graduation project, and now I have determined the topic and officially started my graduation project.</p>
<h2 id="topic-selection">Topic selection</h2>
<p>I already selected a topic before, which was proposed to me by my master tutor. It&rsquo;s about cyber security. I think it&rsquo;s quite appropriate. On the one hand, I can learn some knowledge about cyber security in advance, on the other hand, I can also complete my graduation project. This is killing two birds with one stone.</p>
<h2 id="meeting">Meeting</h2>
<p>After the mobilization meeting of the graduation project, I met with my adviser. He hosted a short meeting for us and talked a lot. It’s nothing. The only thing is that a WeCom group was created, and he became the &ldquo;寨主 (zhàizhǔ, brigand chief)&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="report">Report</h2>
<p>Although I selected a topic before, I still need to think about it seriously. After all, the graduation project is not so casual. My adviser posted some reference topics in the group, all of which are quite classic. However, that topic is very new to me. I have never worked in this field before. In general, I prefer the topic of cyber security, and my master tutor also hopes that I will complete this topic very well. So I reported it to my adviser.</p>
<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
<div class="details admonition quote open">
    <div class="details-summary admonition-title">
      <i class="icon fa-solid fa-quote-right fa-fw" aria-hidden="true"></i>What the adviser said:<i class="details-icon fa-solid fa-angle-right fa-fw" aria-hidden="true"></i>
    </div>
    <div class="details-content">
      <div class="admonition-content"><p>The 题目 (tímù, Which means &ldquo;title&rdquo; or &ldquo;topic&rdquo; in Chinese.) is incomplete.</p>
<p>Write a complete one.</p>
</div>
    </div>
  </div>
<p>Okay, I described my topic more completely, waiting for his opinion. The message has been read, but there has been no reply. It&rsquo;s inexplicable, wouldn&rsquo;t he forget it? The next day, I sent him a message and asked his opinion again, and suddenly received a 59-second voice message.</p>
<div class="details admonition quote open">
    <div class="details-summary admonition-title">
      <i class="icon fa-solid fa-quote-right fa-fw" aria-hidden="true"></i>What the adviser said:<i class="details-icon fa-solid fa-angle-right fa-fw" aria-hidden="true"></i>
    </div>
    <div class="details-content">
      <div class="admonition-content">&hellip; Yous is not a 题目 at all, yours is just a spoken expression. How could that be a 题目? And the work you will do, to be honest, is too searchable. I can’t say&hellip; If I don’t see the specific content. Then what you do can be more or less. The requirements for you, I don’t know&hellip; If it’s low, it’s very simple and not too difficult; if it&rsquo;s high, that&rsquo;s a certain degree of difficulty, okay? Then you wrote so much, how could yours be a 题目? Yours is Just a Spoken Expression! Your spoken expression, how can I decide for you? You want to determine it, can I decide on a spoken expression for you? Can it be a 题目? You can&rsquo;t write a 题目 yourself, you ask me to decide? Deciding a spoken expression for you, is appropriate? Ok? After you’ve thought about it yourself, we will have a basis for discussion. Otherwise, there is nothing to say!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
<p>I was stunned, he said mine is not a topic. Regardless of whether it is a topic or not, if he thinks mine is not a topic and he has opinions or questions, couldn&rsquo;t he tell me directly? I can modify or improve it! He keeps not replying, can I know what he thinks?</p>
<p>I experienced this situation for the first time since I was born, and I didn&rsquo;t know what it meant to me. I also told my master tutor about this matter.</p>
<div class="details admonition quote open">
    <div class="details-summary admonition-title">
      <i class="icon fa-solid fa-quote-right fa-fw" aria-hidden="true"></i>The first message she replied to was:<i class="details-icon fa-solid fa-angle-right fa-fw" aria-hidden="true"></i>
    </div>
    <div class="details-content">
      <div class="admonition-content">Why?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
<p>I also showed her the voice of my adviser, and she helped me determine a title. Here I suddenly discovered that there may be a misunderstanding. Does the &ldquo;题目&rdquo; mentioned by my adviser refer to the &ldquo;title&rdquo; or the &ldquo;topic&rdquo;? I checked the <em>Modern Chinese Normative Dictionary</em>, and &ldquo;题目&rdquo; does have multiple meanings. He said that my &ldquo;题目&rdquo; was a &ldquo;spoken expression&rdquo;, and it seemed that the &ldquo;题目&rdquo; mentioned by him refers to the &ldquo;title&rdquo;.</p>
<p>If so, why didn&rsquo;t he make it clear at the beginning that he was talking about a title?</p>
<p>Well, he said that I can&rsquo;t write a title myself, and there is no basis for discussion. Then I sent him the determined title, hoping for further discussion. However, he still has nothing to say.</p>
<p>At that time, I felt that the &ldquo;title&rdquo; or &ldquo;topic&rdquo; may not be the key. I thought of him saying in the group, &ldquo;from this class, the educational administration is going to start the graduation project management system&rdquo;, &ldquo;all through the system&rdquo;, and &ldquo;leave traces&rdquo;. &ldquo;Moreover&rdquo;, &ldquo;qualification for the Washington Accord is in progress&rdquo;, and &ldquo;advisers strictly control the quality of topics&rdquo;. I thought it may not be easy for him to check the professional level and workload of this topic. After all, he is not researching cyber security, and there should be no similar topics in the past. He has been difficult to conclude, so he has nothing to say.</p>
<p>I told my master tutor what I thought, and she suggested that I explain it to him in more detail. Therefore, I wrote a document that was a bit like an opening report. I wrote out the specific tasks to be done, and also initially planned the time allocation for each task. I sent it to my adviser and asked him to express his opinions directly if he had any questions.</p>
<p>Finally, my adviser started to discuss it with me.</p>
<div class="details admonition quote open">
    <div class="details-summary admonition-title">
      <i class="icon fa-solid fa-quote-right fa-fw" aria-hidden="true"></i>What the adviser said:<i class="details-icon fa-solid fa-angle-right fa-fw" aria-hidden="true"></i>
    </div>
    <div class="details-content">
      <div class="admonition-content">You can submit it.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
<h2 id="end">End</h2>
<p>In any case, the topic has been determined, and now it&rsquo;s time to complete the project.</p>]]></description>

  <title>How My Wesite Was Built?</title>
  <link>https://www.kayak4665664.com/how-my-wesite-was-built/</link>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>At present, my website has stabilized and entered the routine maintenance stage. Now let&rsquo;s review how it was built. There are various guidelines on the Internet, and this article is mainly about my own experience, so I won&rsquo;t involve those repeated details.</p>
<h2 id="beginning">Beginning</h2>
<p>Two weeks ago, I saw someone using Github as a free cloud drive. I have seen someone take notes and blog in a repository. Suddenly, I wanted to have a place to write something to record myself. I searched for how to blog on Github, and then I found <a href="https://pages.github.com"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">Github Pages<i class="fa-solid fa-external-link-alt fa-fw fa-xs ms-1 text-secondary" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>. In short, it can automatically host static webpages for free, and it is more than enough to build a blog of my own.</p>
<h3 id="domain">Domain</h3>
<p><a href="https://pages.github.com"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">Github Pages<i class="fa-solid fa-external-link-alt fa-fw fa-xs ms-1 text-secondary" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> is free, but its URLs all look like <code>username.github.io</code>, which feels not personalized enough. Fortunately, it supports custom domains, so I decided to buy one. The website hadn&rsquo;t been built yet, but I bought it first. I heard that buying a domain in China requires real-name verification, and the verification takes several days. If I wait for the verification while building my website, it will save time. Finally, I bought <code>kayak4665664.com</code>.</p>
<div class="details admonition tip open">
    <div class="details-summary admonition-title">
      <i class="icon fa-solid fa-lightbulb fa-fw" aria-hidden="true"></i>Tip<i class="details-icon fa-solid fa-angle-right fa-fw" aria-hidden="true"></i>
    </div>
    <div class="details-content">
      <div class="admonition-content">Some domains look cheap when they are registered in the first year, but later renewals are more expensive than <code>.com</code> domain.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
<h3 id="usernamegithubio">username.github.io</h3>
<p>Created a new repository and set <code>Pages</code> settings. <a href="https://pages.github.com"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">Github Pages<i class="fa-solid fa-external-link-alt fa-fw fa-xs ms-1 text-secondary" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> uses <code>Jekyll</code> to transform plain text into static websites, so it will let you choose your <code>Jekyll</code> theme during the setup process. I even carefully compared those themes and chose the one that I thought was the best-looking. I soon discovered that these themes were too simple to meet my needs. Then I used <code>git</code> to clone the repository to the local.</p>
<h3 id="design">Design</h3>
<p>I visited some others&rsquo; websites and initially determined that my website should have the functions of comments, visit count, and in-site search. In addition, I also wanted to add Baidu and Google Analytics and let them index my website.</p>
<h3 id="tool">Tool</h3>
<p>In addition to <code>Jekyll</code>, there are many tools for transforming plain text into static websites and blogs, such as the <code>Hugo</code> I use now. Since <a href="https://pages.github.com"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">Github Pages<i class="fa-solid fa-external-link-alt fa-fw fa-xs ms-1 text-secondary" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> uses <code>Jekyll</code> by default, I chose <code>Jekyll</code>.</p>
<p><code>Jekyll</code> is based on <code>Ruby</code> and can be installed with <code>gem</code>. I use macOS and <code>Ruby</code> is a built-in software. I directly executed <code>gem install jekyll bundler</code> to start installing <code>Jekyll</code>, <code>Bundler</code>, and their dependencies. During the installation, <code>fatal error:'ruby/config.h' file not found</code> appeared. I googled it and found that some people said the version of the built-in <code>Ruby</code> was too low, but others said that it was a problem with <code>Xcode CommandLineTools</code>. I installed a new <code>Ruby</code> with <code>Homebrew</code> directly. After installation, set the environment variables in the terminal, re-executed <code>gem install jekyll bundler</code>, and the installation was complete this time.</p>
<div class="details admonition warning open">
    <div class="details-summary admonition-title">
      <i class="icon fa-solid fa-exclamation-triangle fa-fw" aria-hidden="true"></i>Warning<i class="details-icon fa-solid fa-angle-right fa-fw" aria-hidden="true"></i>
    </div>
    <div class="details-content">
      <div class="admonition-content">I also searched for how to clean up the cache and installed packages of the last <code>gem install jekyll bundler</code>, but I didn&rsquo;t find it. I had to manually uninstall the installed packages and delete the directory where the cache was located. I felt that it was not cleaned up at all.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
<h2 id="jekyll">Jekyll</h2>
<h3 id="getting-start">Getting start</h3>
<p>Executed <code>bundle exec jekyll serve</code> in the workplace, and <code>cannot load such file - webrick (LoadError)</code> appeared. I googled it and then solved it with <code>bundle add webrick</code>.</p>
<p>I previewed it locally and felt there were no problems. I prepared to <code>push</code> it to Github and test it with my mobile phone. But there was a problem, <code>push</code> did not work. Google didn&rsquo;t find it, but Baidu found that it may be a problem with <code>proxy</code>. It was resolved after unseting the proxy settings of <code>git</code>.</p>
<p>Browsing with my phone, the webpage was automatically adapted to the mobile interface. At this time, I found that this theme was too simple, and it didn&rsquo;t even have a pagination. In the beginning, I was planning to implement it myself, but I thought that so many functions would have to be implemented one by one, and the workload was huge. I&rsquo;d better find a theme with more complete functions.</p>
<h3 id="theme">Theme</h3>
<p>There are many <code>Jekyll</code> themes on the Internet and finally downloaded <a href="https://github.com/jeffreytse/jekyll-theme-yat"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">YAT<i class="fa-solid fa-external-link-alt fa-fw fa-xs ms-1 text-secondary" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>. It has many functions. We can use <a href="Disqus.com">Disqus</a> and <a href="https://github.com/imsun/gitment"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">Gitment<i class="fa-solid fa-external-link-alt fa-fw fa-xs ms-1 text-secondary" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> to comment.</p>
<p>After downloading, I wanted to execute <code>bundle exec jekyll serve</code> to preview it, but the error <code>Could not find gem 'jekyll-spaceship (~&gt; 0.2)'</code> appeared. I solved it by setting the version to <code>0.2</code> when installing <code>jekyll-spaceship</code> by <code>gem</code>. Here I also found that the installation was stuck, but there was no error. Using the <code>Activity Monitor</code>, I saw that the <code>Rcvd Bytes</code> of <code>Ruby</code> have been increasing slowly, which should be a network problem in China. Googled it, then found a way on <a href="https://gems.ruby-china.com"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">Ruby China<i class="fa-solid fa-external-link-alt fa-fw fa-xs ms-1 text-secondary" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> to change the sources. The installation was successful after changing them.</p>
<p>Executed <code>bundle exec jekyll serve</code> again and this time I previewed the new theme.</p>
<h3 id="personalizing">Personalizing</h3>
<p>According to our own needs, we can make personalized changes to the theme, such as titles, pictures, etc. I originally wanted to use <a href="https://github.com/imsun/gitment"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">Gitment<i class="fa-solid fa-external-link-alt fa-fw fa-xs ms-1 text-secondary" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>, but I found that it can&rsquo;t log in to the Github account. I took a look at its <a href="https://github.com/imsun/gitment/issues"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">Issues<i class="fa-solid fa-external-link-alt fa-fw fa-xs ms-1 text-secondary" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> and then found that the service should be stopped. So I can only use <a href="Disqus.com">Disqus</a>, I registered a <a href="Disqus.com">Disqus</a> account and turned on the comment function. In addition, I also used <a href="http://busuanzi.ibruce.info"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">Bu Suanzi<i class="fa-solid fa-external-link-alt fa-fw fa-xs ms-1 text-secondary" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> for website traffic statistics, which only requires two lines of code.</p>
<p>Then I started to add some content. In the process of previewing the content, I gradually discovered some problems. The font of this theme was too small, and the contrast between the text and the background was low whether in light or dark mode. In short, I felt that reading it tortures my eyes. However, the font cannot be set in the configuration file. I can only modify the <code>.scss</code> files one by one, which is more troublesome. And its translation function called Google&rsquo;s webpage translation interface, was almost unusable under the Chinese network, causing the webpage to become stuck. I directly deleted the translation-related part of the source code. In addition, <a href="Disqus.com">Disqus</a> cannot log in to the account under the Chinese network. After a test, only anonymous guest comments can be used. This is also a disadvantage.</p>
<h3 id="giving-up">Giving up</h3>
<p>After personalization, I felt that there was no problem. It suddenly occurred to me that the <a href="https://github.com/jeffreytse/jekyll-theme-yat"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">YAT<i class="fa-solid fa-external-link-alt fa-fw fa-xs ms-1 text-secondary" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> theme also supports PlantUML, Mermaid, Mathjax, Vedio, Audio, etc. I should test it again. I directly used the author&rsquo;s <code>markdown</code> files to test and found that these things were not displayed normally.</p>
<p>I thought it was because I changed the source code. I directly cloned the author&rsquo;s repository. After testing, I found that the same does not work. It seems that it is not a problem with my code modification. But I haven&rsquo;t found the problem. Considering that there were other shortcomings in this theme, I chose to abandon it.</p>
<p>I started looking for the subject again, this time more carefully. Finally, I found the <a href="https://github.com/dillonzq/LoveIt"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">LoveIt<i class="fa-solid fa-external-link-alt fa-fw fa-xs ms-1 text-secondary" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> theme, which is what I use now.</p>
<p>This is a theme based on <code>Hugo</code>, so <code>Ruby</code> was useless, I uninstalled it.</p>
<h2 id="hugo">Hugo</h2>
<h3 id="getting-start-1">Getting start</h3>
<p>First used <code>Homebrew</code> to install <code>Hugo</code>, <a href="https://github.com/dillonzq/LoveIt"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">LoveIt<i class="fa-solid fa-external-link-alt fa-fw fa-xs ms-1 text-secondary" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> recommends installing the <code>extended</code> version of <code>Hugo</code>, and the <code>Hugo</code> installed by <code>Homebrew</code> is the <code>extended</code> version.</p>
<p>The directory structure of <code>Hugo</code> is still different from that of <code>Jekyll</code>, it took some time to get familiar with. <a href="https://github.com/dillonzq/LoveIt"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">LoveIt<i class="fa-solid fa-external-link-alt fa-fw fa-xs ms-1 text-secondary" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> has a lot of configuration items, and we need to take a look at the document first.</p>
<p>Approximately configured, executed <code>hugo serve -e production --disableFastRender</code> to preview.</p>
<h3 id="personalizing-1">Personalizing</h3>
<p>After that were personalized settings, as well as:</p>
<ol>
<li>Registered <a href="https://www.leancloud.cn"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">LeanCloud<i class="fa-solid fa-external-link-alt fa-fw fa-xs ms-1 text-secondary" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> and <a href="https://valine.js.org"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">Valine<i class="fa-solid fa-external-link-alt fa-fw fa-xs ms-1 text-secondary" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> for comments and visit statistics</li>
<li>Used <a href="https://realfavicongenerator.net"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://realfavicongenerator.net<i class="fa-solid fa-external-link-alt fa-fw fa-xs ms-1 text-secondary" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> to generate website icons</li>
<li>Registered <a href="http://Gravatar.com"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">Gravartar<i class="fa-solid fa-external-link-alt fa-fw fa-xs ms-1 text-secondary" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></li>
<li>Registered <a href="https://www.algolia.com"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">Algolia<i class="fa-solid fa-external-link-alt fa-fw fa-xs ms-1 text-secondary" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> for site search</li>
<li>Used <code>node.js</code> to execute <code>npm install atomic-algolia</code> to install <a href="https://github.com/chrisdmacrae/atomic-algolia"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">atomic-algolia<i class="fa-solid fa-external-link-alt fa-fw fa-xs ms-1 text-secondary" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> to automatically upload index files to <a href="https://www.algolia.com"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">Algolia<i class="fa-solid fa-external-link-alt fa-fw fa-xs ms-1 text-secondary" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></li>
<li>Registered <a href="https://www.mapbox.com"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">Mapbox<i class="fa-solid fa-external-link-alt fa-fw fa-xs ms-1 text-secondary" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></li>
</ol>
<p>During this period, I also found a problem. The custom <code>404</code> template could not be displayed in the local preview. Google found it:
<div class="details admonition info open">
    <div class="details-summary admonition-title">
      <i class="icon fa-solid fa-info-circle fa-fw" aria-hidden="true"></i>Info<i class="details-icon fa-solid fa-angle-right fa-fw" aria-hidden="true"></i>
    </div>
    <div class="details-content">
      <div class="admonition-content"><code>hugo server</code> will not automatically load your custom <code>404.html</code> file, but you can test the appearance of your custom “not found” page by navigating your browser to <code>/404.html</code>.</div>
    </div>
  </div></p>
<h3 id="extension">Extension</h3>
<p>The website was almost built. Executed <code>hugo</code>, and the <code>/public</code> directory would appear. Synchronized <code>/public</code> with our repository, and we can host the webpage to <a href="https://pages.github.com"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">Github Pages<i class="fa-solid fa-external-link-alt fa-fw fa-xs ms-1 text-secondary" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>. Then used <a href="https://github.com/chrisdmacrae/atomic-algolia"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">atomic-algolia<i class="fa-solid fa-external-link-alt fa-fw fa-xs ms-1 text-secondary" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> to upload the generated index file to <a href="https://www.algolia.com"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">Algolia<i class="fa-solid fa-external-link-alt fa-fw fa-xs ms-1 text-secondary" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>. After these two steps, a website deployment was completed.</p>
<p>In addition, I built a private repository for synchronizing source code other than <code>/public</code>, so every deployment needs to be synchronized once more. To automate these three processes, I wrote a <code>Shell</code> script. Only one step.</p>
<p>At this time, my domain finally passed the real-name verification. I started to make some extensions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set up <code>CNAME</code> on Github</li>
<li>Imported the repository into <a href="https://vercel.com/"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">Vercel<i class="fa-solid fa-external-link-alt fa-fw fa-xs ms-1 text-secondary" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>, so that every time the repository is updated, it will be automatically deployed to <a href="https://vercel.com/"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">Vercel<i class="fa-solid fa-external-link-alt fa-fw fa-xs ms-1 text-secondary" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>. It is said that Baidu will not index sites hosted by <a href="https://pages.github.com"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">Github Pages<i class="fa-solid fa-external-link-alt fa-fw fa-xs ms-1 text-secondary" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>, and it can be indexed after being deployed to <a href="https://vercel.com/"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">Vercel<i class="fa-solid fa-external-link-alt fa-fw fa-xs ms-1 text-secondary" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></li>

  <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/description/"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">LeetCode 42.Trapping Rain Water<i class="fa-solid fa-external-link-alt fa-fw fa-xs ms-1 text-secondary" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>, a very interesting problem.</p>
<p>Given <code>n</code> non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is <code>1</code>, compute how much water it can trap after raining.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<div align="center">
<a class="lightgallery" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/kayak4665664/My-images/rainwatertrap.png" data-thumbnail="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/kayak4665664/My-images/rainwatertrap.png" data-sub-html="<h2>rainwatertrap</h2><p>rainwatertrap</p>"></a>
</div>
<p><strong>Input</strong>: height = <code>[0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1]</code><br>
<strong>Output</strong>: <code>6</code><br>
<strong>Explanation</strong>: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array <code>[0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1]</code>. In this case, <code>6</code> units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.</p>
<p>At first I wanted to solve it with <code>stack</code>, but it didn&rsquo;t feel good. Then I just calculated directly up and down, but <code>Time Limit Exceeded</code>:</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>Today I participated in the thesis proposal through the Tencent Meeting.</p>
<p>The original plan was to start at 1:30 p.m. I don&rsquo;t know why we waited until 2 p.m😶. There were 24 students and 3 judges in this thesis proposal this afternoon. I was number 12 and waited until 4 p.m. to finally get my turn. Overall, it went relatively smoothly, but there was a teacher who was studying computer networks coincidentally, and my topic involved a lot of network stuff, so I was questioned closely.</p>
<p>After my turn, because the teacher didn&rsquo;t say we could withdraw, I just continued to stay in the meeting to watch others. An unnamed student was recommended to study at the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences for postgraduate study without examination, his graduation project was in cooperation with Huawei. He said that the results of his graduation project would beat the previous work of his supervisor, and he was determined to submit a paper to the top conference as well👍.</p>
<p>Such excellent classmates inspire me to do my work better, and keep working hard👍.</p>]]></description>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>The graduation project is finally coming to an end, and the final defense will be held on the afternoon of June 9!</p>
<p>Now that I have completed most of the work on my graduation project, these last two weeks have been relatively relaxing. But I am now quarantined and can only stay in the room every day🙃, and today is the 4th day.</p>
<p>At noon on May 27, I went to the canteen to have lunch as usual. As soon as I returned to my dormitory, I suddenly received a notice from the school asking graduates to leave the school as soon as possible. I realized right away that this would be my last few days at the North China University of Technology.</p>
<div align="center">
<figure><a class="lightgallery" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/kayak4665664/My-images/IMG_1421.jpeg" data-thumbnail="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/kayak4665664/My-images/IMG_1421.jpeg" data-sub-html="<h2>the notice</h2><p>the notice</p>"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">the notice</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>
<p>I calmed down a bit and immediately started planning what I had to do before I left school. The first thing to consider is my luggage. Fortunately, the school promised that it can be delivered for free. Otherwise, I can&rsquo;t afford the cost of expressing so many things. However, I didn&rsquo;t have a cardboard box for packing. I asked the counselor and he only said it would be released later. I felt his answer was too vague, and I decided to go buy a few cardboard boxes myself. I went to the school express outlet and found the boss there. He told me that our college had taken more than 100 cardboard boxes from him before. I estimated that a student should only get 1 cardboard box. So, I bought 4 large cardboard boxes from the boss for ¥45.</p>
<p>With the cardboard box, I went back to my dormitory to pack the luggage. At the same time, I had to report to the community where my family live. I contacted the staff in the community and she told me that I would be quarantined for 7 days and then quarantined at home for 7 days. I didn&rsquo;t think this is reasonable. I have taken dozens of nucleic acid tests during school, and they have never been positive, and the school has always been closed. People outside the school can&rsquo;t come in, and people inside the school can&rsquo;t get out. I don&rsquo;t think I should be quarantined for 7 days. And as far as I know, some places do not require centralized quarantine for students returning from Beijing. I explained it to her, but it didn&rsquo;t work. Fortunately, centralized quarantine is free, otherwise, it will cost a lot of money. In those days, I saw the news that some college students were quarantined after returning home and charged ¥500 a day.</p>
<p>After packing my luggage, I felt a little hot and I noticed that my hair was a little longer. As soon as I thought that I was going to be quarantined for half a month, I went to the barber shop to cut my hair short.</p>
<p>In the evening, the counselor finally informed us that we could go get the cardboard box, and I got a cardboard box and a sack. With the 4 large cardboard boxes I bought, it was just right.</p>
<p>On the morning of May 28, I went to the supermarket to buy a marker and I had to mark my address on the box. I walked into the dormitory building, and a dormitory administrator who was familiar with me told me that I could take my luggage to the express outlet now, and reminded me to hurry up. Considering that I have to move 4 cartons and 1 sack from the dormitory to the outlet, it is not easy to rely on only two hands, so I went to the outlet and borrowed a flatbed trolley from the boss. I went back to my dormitory, marked all 5 items with my information, put them all on the trolley, and all of them were shipped to the express outlet at once.</p>
<div align="center">
<figure><a class="lightgallery" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/kayak4665664/My-images/IMG_1332.jpeg" data-thumbnail="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/kayak4665664/My-images/IMG_1332.jpeg" data-sub-html="<h2>the flatbed trolley</h2><p>the flatbed trolley</p>"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">the flatbed trolley</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>
<p>Since the notice of the graduates leaving the school was rushed, the boss of the express outlet frankly said that they did not know how to handle the luggage of so many students, and there were only two people in the entire outlet including him. When I pushed the flat trolley to the outlet, I saw that there were already many boxes piled up outside. I was a little worried that so many boxes would be confused, so I asked the boss to affix notes to my luggage first so that I could also track it easily. By the time I had dealt with all this, it was already past noon. When I arrived at the canteen, I bought a large plate of Jiaozi. I have to say that it is delicious, with a lot of meat in it.</p>
<div align="center">

  </figure>
</div>
<p>At night, I tracked that my luggage had been sent out, and I felt that they were efficient.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of May 29, the boss suddenly called me. What I was worried about had happened. He said that they made the wrong notes and sent a box of other people&rsquo;s luggage to my address, and my box is still in the outlet😱. I hurried to the outlet again, and one of my boxes was still lying on the shelf.</p>
<p>On May 30, there is nothing special on this day, everything has been dealt with.</p>
<p>On May 31, I woke up before the alarm went off, my last day at school. Get up for breakfast. After that, I started packing sheets, quilts, pillows, and my suitcase. I had to bring enough daily necessities, and I was going to be quarantined at night. I packed the bedding into the little cardboard box released by the college, and it just fit inside. I took the box to the outlet, the door was open but no one was there. After waiting for half an hour, the boss finally came.</p>
<p>At noon, I went to the canteen for lunch, which was my last meal at school.</p>
<p>I went back to my dormitory and lay on the mattress. This mattress is too big to be expressed, so I left it here.</p>
<p>At about 3 pm, I packed my suitcase, closed the windows, turned off the electric breaker switch, took a last look at my dormitory, and locked the door. I went downstairs to the dormitory administrator and returned my key.</p>
<p>And then I left school and probably never went back.</p>
<div align="center">

  </figure>
</div>
<p>The photo above was taken on the 31st. On the afternoon of the 30th, I saw someone playing with these signs, but it was still 2021 at that time.</p>
<p>After leaving school, I took the subway to the train station.</p>
<p>At about 8 pm, I got off the train. Soon, someone started to check the traveler&rsquo;s place of departure. I was leaving Beijing and needed to be sent to a quarantined hotel.</p>
<p>After I filled out a document, my ID was seized. They said they would give it back to me. I don&rsquo;t know who they are, but I think their behavior violates the Resident Identity Card Law of the People&rsquo;s Republic of China. After that, there was a long wait, standing for more than 2 hours, and no one came to deal with it. Overall, it was an unpleasant experience.</p>
<p>At about 10 pm, someone finally came to meet us, and finally returned my ID card to me. Then we took nucleic acid tests.</p>
<p>Our group got into the car and finally arrived at the quarantine hotel around 11 pm. After another long wait, I was already sleepy and exhausted. After another nucleic acid test, I finally entered the room. After the bed was made, it was nearly 1:00 on June 1st.</p>
<p>To be honest, the environment of the hotel is not bad, I can eat and drink on time, and I have had a good time in the past 4 days.</p>
<p>There are still 3 days of centralized quarantine that will end, and 7 days of home quarantine will begin. During this period, the final defense will be held on June 9.</p>
<p>Time flies so fast. When I went back to school on March 15, it was still snowing in Beijing. In a blink of an eye, I suddenly went home again. My 4 years of university life are coming to an end soon, and I will always remember the 4 years at the North China University of Technology.</p>]]></description>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>There are always some software icons that are not compatible with macOS. iconsur can generate rounded rectangle icons for them to beautify our macOS.</p>
<p>iconsur&rsquo;s Github homepage: <a href="https://github.com/rikumi/iconsur"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/rikumi/iconsur<i class="fa-solid fa-external-link-alt fa-fw fa-xs ms-1 text-secondary" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>, can be downloaded in <a href="https://github.com/rikumi/iconsur/releases"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">Releases<i class="fa-solid fa-external-link-alt fa-fw fa-xs ms-1 text-secondary" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>. You can also use Homebrew: <code>brew install iconsur</code>, or npm: <code>npm install -g iconsur</code>.</p>
<p>iconsur finds the most similar iOS app for the software in the App Store and replaces the icon of this software with the icon of the iOS app. For example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><div class="chroma">
<table class="lntable"><tr><td class="lntd">
<pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="lnt">1
</span></code></pre></td>

    </div>
    <div class="details-content">
      <div class="admonition-content">Since the laptop uses a lithium battery, a long-term connection to the power adapter will cause the battery to always be at a high percentage, which will shorten the life of the battery. Therefore, keeping the percentage between 20% and 80% can delay the decay of the battery.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
<p>For MacBook, I found software that can solve this problem: <a href="https://github.com/davidwernhart/AlDente-Charge-Limiter"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">AlDente<i class="fa-solid fa-external-link-alt fa-fw fa-xs ms-1 text-secondary" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>.</p>

<p>After launching AlDente, this software appears in the menu bar, which can easily control the maximum charging percentage of the MacBook. Afterward, it can be observed that the power adapter is connected, but the battery is not charging.</p>]]></description>

      </div><p>The first semester at UCAS passed quickly, and I feel that the experience of this semester is very rich.</p>
<p>I arrived in Huaibei Town, Huairou District, Beijing on August 17, 2022. I visited Yanqi Lake in the afternoon. Yanqi Lake is a very big lake. There are many trees🌳 by the lake, many boats🛶 on the lake, and many people by the lake. There is also a trail leading to somewhere on the mountain by the lake. I walked on this road for a long time and felt good. Unfortunately, the road was interrupted due to construction🚧. Later, I learned about this road and the viewing platform of UCAS is connected. I saw a lot of birds🐦 on the mountain by the lake. They flew on the lake and chirped on the trees by the lake.</p>
<div align="center">

  </figure>
</div>
<p>After staying in a farmhouse inn in the village next to Yanqi Lake for one night, I went to UCAS early the next morning. It rained🌧️ all day, and my clothes and shoes were soaked, but when I first arrived at school, everything felt so fresh and I was in a good mood🙂.</p>

<p>With the nucleic acid test every two days, this semester started. The quality and difficulty of the courses offered by UCAS are indeed higher than those offered by NCUT, and I feel that I have gained more. In addition to class, I often ride a bicycle🚲 around the school to see the scenery of the campus. Because the school is backed by mountains and Yanqi Lake, the ecological environment of the school is very good. There are often little animals🐱, and it is said that there are beasts of prey such as boars🐗 and snakes🐍.</p>

<p>In the early morning of October 15th, our entire dormitory was suddenly notified to be quarantined on the spot, and each of us was sent a hearty breakfast and a large bucket of water. Before I finished eating, We were notified again that the quarantine is over, which is inexplicable😅.</p>

<p>At the end of November, the school became not so peaceful. As the Omicron epidemic became more serious in winter, many colleges and universities in Beijing began to arrange for students to return home. In the beginning, UCAS still required students to complete all the exams at school, and then finally allowed students to return to their hometowns on November 29. All kinds of gossip spread in the school for a while: some people said that there was a student who tested positive for nucleic acid in the school, and all the students could not go home, and they might be quarantined in the dormitory; someone said that after leaving the school and entering the urban area of Beijing, someone would search the mobile phone at the train station or other places&hellip; It feels a bit panicky.</p>
<p>Since the city where my family is located was under lockdown, I didn&rsquo;t know when it would end, so I decided to stay in school. It is said that if there is an epidemic on campus, the cafeteria may not be able to cook normally, so I quickly stocked up some food. At that time, many express delivery services were interrupted, and JD Express also became very slow.</p>
<p>During those few days, most of the students left the school and went home, and the school was quiet. Around December 5, there was a sudden major change in the epidemic prevention policy, and the nucleic acid test every two days was finally ended. But at this time, infected people began to appear in the school, and I also prepared 2 boxes of compound acetaminophen capsules.</p>
<p>After waking up on the morning of December 19th, I felt my throat was dry and a little sore, and there was a lot of nasal discharge. I must have an infection. That night, my sports watch kept warning me my heart🫀 was beating very fast at around 120BMP. I could hear my heart beating while sitting quietly. I was so scared and I lay down on the bed. My whole body was hot, and my heart rate still couldn&rsquo;t drop. With the sound of my heart beating, I finally fell asleep. Checking the records the next morning, the heart rate slowly dropped to around 90 BMP, which is very abnormal.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know what was wrong with this, since it came out in 2019, I didn&rsquo;t know that the new crown virus could affect the heart. I searched on the Internet, and many people have encountered the same situation as me. It is said that it is viral myocarditis. So I quickly placed an order for coenzyme $Q_{10}$ capsules.</p>
<p>On December 22, I went to pick up an antigen detection reagent, and I was indeed infected with the new coronavirus🦠.</p>
<div align="center">
<figure><a class="lightgallery" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/kayak4665664/My-images/IMG_2066.jpeg" data-thumbnail="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/kayak4665664/My-images/IMG_2066.jpeg" data-sub-html="<h2>Antigen test was positive</h2><p>Antigen test was positive</p>"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Antigen test was positive</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>
<p>After a week, my symptoms gradually disappeared, but I still had some cough and my heart rate was still fast. On December 27, I picked up another antigen test reagent, which was negative this time.</p>
<p>After more than a week, I finished all the exams, my heart rate was still not normal, so I decided to go to Huairou Hospital for a checkup. I had an electrocardiogram, heart color Doppler ultrasound, chest CT scan, and multiple blood tests, and the test results showed no abnormalities. The doctor said that my condition should be the sequelae of the new crown rather than myocarditis, and it would take a long time to recover.</p>
<p>It is already 2023, I just hope that we can resume our life before the epidemic as soon as possible🙏.</p>]]></description>

  <title>Use Phone Buddy on Apple Watch to Prevent Forgotten iPhone</title>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>Today my dad drove me to a place. After I got off the car and walked for 3 minutes, I suddenly found that my mobile phone was missing&hellip;</p>
<p>I hurried back to the same place to look for my mobile phone, but I couldn&rsquo;t find it. Finally, I borrowed a mobile phone from the traffic police on the side of the road and called my father to confirm that my mobile phone was left in the car.</p>
<p>Although Find My has been set to send a notification on the Apple Watch when I leave my iPhone, it seems that this function needs to be at a relatively long distance to take effect.</p>
<p>So I found <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/phone-buddy-phone-lost-alert/id1451559391"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">Phone Buddy<i class="fa-solid fa-external-link-alt fa-fw fa-xs ms-1 text-secondary" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>, the price is $4.99, I <a href="https://www.kayak4665664.com/buy-us-app-store-gift-cards-with-alipay/"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">bought a US App Store Gift Card with Alipay<i class="fa-solid fa-external-link-alt fa-fw fa-xs ms-1 text-secondary" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> to recharge and purchase this App.</p>
<div class="details admonition note open">
    <div class="details-summary admonition-title">
      <i class="icon fa-solid fa-pencil-alt fa-fw" aria-hidden="true"></i>Note<i class="details-icon fa-solid fa-angle-right fa-fw" aria-hidden="true"></i>
    </div>
    <div class="details-content">
      <div class="admonition-content">After downloading Phone Buddy, turn on Lost Phone Alert on the Apple Watch, and when the Apple Watch loses the Bluetooth connection with the iPhone, an alert will be sent to the Apple Watch. And there can also be a Distance Alert. When the Bluetooth signal strength between the Apple Watch and iPhone decays below the set threshold with the increase of distance, an alert can also be issued, so that it can be one more time before the Bluetooth connection is completely disconnected. Similarly, you can also set an alert on the iPhone after the Apple Watch is disconnected, which can prevent the Apple Watch from being lost or forgotten.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
<p>The only downside is that this App will shorten the battery life of the Apple Watch, but compared to losing my iPhone, this price is acceptable.</p>]]></description>

<p>My idea is to traverse from the end to the beginning, if the current digit is 9, then carry, if not, then add 1, and then return the result. If the last digit is 9, then we need to add a 1 at the beginning, at this time we need to create a new array, and then copy the original array.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/15173-visited-lite"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">Visited Lite<i class="fa-solid fa-external-link-alt fa-fw fa-xs ms-1 text-secondary" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> is a userscript to customize the color of visited links, and <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/color-links/hiponeioelghhaljfflaaflpccedbdem/related"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">Color Links<i class="fa-solid fa-external-link-alt fa-fw fa-xs ms-1 text-secondary" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> is a browser extension with similar function.</p>
<p>A few days ago, Microsoft launched new versions of Bing and Edge browsers combined with GPT. I read their introductions on the Internet and felt they were really good. And last year I experienced <a href="https://chat.openai.com/chat"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">ChatGPT<i class="fa-solid fa-external-link-alt fa-fw fa-xs ms-1 text-secondary" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> for the first time, so this time I am looking forward to the new version of Bing and Edge and applied to join the <a href="https://www.bing.com/new"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">waitlist<i class="fa-solid fa-external-link-alt fa-fw fa-xs ms-1 text-secondary" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="details-content">
      <div class="admonition-content">In the process of using Bing, I suddenly discovered a problem. In Bing&rsquo;s search results, the visited links and unvisited links were both purple, it&rsquo;s difficult to distinguish which links are visited and which are not. I have been using Google before, the unvisited links are blue, and the visited links are purple. I didn&rsquo;t find the relevant settings in Bing and I didn&rsquo;t know where the problem was. So I looked for some userscripts or browser extensions to solve this problem.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
<h2 id="visited-lite">Visited Lite</h2>
<p>I found <a href="https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/15173-visited-lite"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">Visited Lite<i class="fa-solid fa-external-link-alt fa-fw fa-xs ms-1 text-secondary" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>, which can customize the color of visited links for all websites, not just Bing&rsquo;s. I installed this userscript in Edge&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.tampermonkey.net/"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">Tampermonkey<i class="fa-solid fa-external-link-alt fa-fw fa-xs ms-1 text-secondary" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> extension. <a href="https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/15173-visited-lite"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">Visited Lite<i class="fa-solid fa-external-link-alt fa-fw fa-xs ms-1 text-secondary" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> marks all visited links with bold color. However, some web pages may not need this function, and they can be excluded from the <a href="https://www.tampermonkey.net/"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">Tampermonkey<i class="fa-solid fa-external-link-alt fa-fw fa-xs ms-1 text-secondary" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>](<a href="https://www.tampermonkey.net/"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://www.tampermonkey.net/<i class="fa-solid fa-external-link-alt fa-fw fa-xs ms-1 text-secondary" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>) extension.</p>
<h2 id="color-links">Color Links</h2>
<p>After that, I found <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/color-links/hiponeioelghhaljfflaaflpccedbdem/related"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">Color Links<i class="fa-solid fa-external-link-alt fa-fw fa-xs ms-1 text-secondary" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> in the chrome web store. The main difference from <a href="https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/15173-visited-lite"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">Visited Lite<i class="fa-solid fa-external-link-alt fa-fw fa-xs ms-1 text-secondary" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> is that <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/color-links/hiponeioelghhaljfflaaflpccedbdem/related"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">Color Links<i class="fa-solid fa-external-link-alt fa-fw fa-xs ms-1 text-secondary" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> need to manually enable the marking function for each website.</p>]]></description>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>Since joining the <a href="https://www.bing.com/new"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">waitlist<i class="fa-solid fa-external-link-alt fa-fw fa-xs ms-1 text-secondary" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> on February 11th, I finally received an email today that I can use the new Bing.</p>
<div class="details admonition bug open">
    <div class="details-summary admonition-title">
      <i class="icon fa-solid fa-bug fa-fw" aria-hidden="true"></i>Bug<i class="details-icon fa-solid fa-angle-right fa-fw" aria-hidden="true"></i>
    </div>
    <div class="details-content">
      <div class="admonition-content">I couldn&rsquo;t wait to open Edge Dev and enter CHAT, but I soon found that I couldn&rsquo;t input all the characters normally in the input box. I tried it again in Safari and it worked perfectly, so there is probably something wrong with Edge Dev.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
<p>After a few rounds of conversations with the new Bing, it felt like it was a bit lacking in conversational enthusiasm, often asking me to change the subject. Moreover, the prompt “This has been lovely, but you’ve reached your daily limit. Chat again tomorrow?” appeared within a few minutes.</p>
<p>I have to say that a very useful feature of the new Bing is that it can obtain information from the web pages and documents we are reading. I tested it, opened a local PDF file with Edge Dev, clicked the Discover button to chat, and the new Bing can summarize the main points in this file. In addition, it can also easily generate some text in Discover.</p>
<p>According to my experience, I think the new Bing is really good, and I am very much looking forward to the official version in the future.</p>]]></description>

<p>After entering the Depay App, click Apply for a card. In the beginning, you can choose a standard card and a Lite card. The Lite card does not require KYC. Now there are 5 types of cards (Lite, Standard, Premium, Platinum, and Black Gold). The difference is mainly in the card opening fee, monthly fee, and recharge fee. The standard card opening fee is 0, the specific difference can be found on the <a href="https://depay.one/en-us/rights.html"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">official website<i class="fa-solid fa-external-link-alt fa-fw fa-xs ms-1 text-secondary" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>Since joining the <a href="https://www.bing.com/new"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">waitlist<i class="fa-solid fa-external-link-alt fa-fw fa-xs ms-1 text-secondary" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> on February 11th, I finally received an email today that I can use the new Bing.</p>
<div class="details admonition bug open">
    <div class="details-summary admonition-title">
      <i class="icon fa-solid fa-bug fa-fw" aria-hidden="true"></i>Bug<i class="details-icon fa-solid fa-angle-right fa-fw" aria-hidden="true"></i>
    </div>
    <div class="details-content">
      <div class="admonition-content">I couldn&rsquo;t wait to open Edge Dev and enter CHAT, but I soon found that I couldn&rsquo;t input all the characters normally in the input box. I tried it again in Safari and it worked perfectly, so there is probably something wrong with Edge Dev.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
<p>After a few rounds of conversations with the new Bing, it felt like it was a bit lacking in conversational enthusiasm, often asking me to change the subject. Moreover, the prompt “This has been lovely, but you’ve reached your daily limit. Chat again tomorrow?” appeared within a few minutes.</p>
<p>I have to say that a very useful feature of the new Bing is that it can obtain information from the web pages and documents we are reading. I tested it, opened a local PDF file with Edge Dev, clicked the Discover button to chat, and the new Bing can summarize the main points in this file. In addition, it can also easily generate some text in Discover.</p>
<p>According to my experience, I think the new Bing is really good, and I am very much looking forward to the official version in the future.</p>]]></description>

<p>A few days ago, Microsoft launched new versions of Bing and Edge browsers combined with GPT. I read their introductions on the Internet and felt they were really good. And last year I experienced <a href="https://chat.openai.com/chat"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">ChatGPT<i class="fa-solid fa-external-link-alt fa-fw fa-xs ms-1 text-secondary" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> for the first time, so this time I am looking forward to the new version of Bing and Edge and applied to join the <a href="https://www.bing.com/new"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">waitlist<i class="fa-solid fa-external-link-alt fa-fw fa-xs ms-1 text-secondary" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>.</p>

    <div class="details-content">
      <div class="admonition-content">In the process of using Bing, I suddenly discovered a problem. In Bing&rsquo;s search results, the visited links and unvisited links were both purple, it&rsquo;s difficult to distinguish which links are visited and which are not. I have been using Google before, the unvisited links are blue, and the visited links are purple. I didn&rsquo;t find the relevant settings in Bing and I didn&rsquo;t know where the problem was. So I looked for some userscripts or browser extensions to solve this problem.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
<h2 id="visited-lite">Visited Lite</h2>
<p>I found <a href="https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/15173-visited-lite"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">Visited Lite<i class="fa-solid fa-external-link-alt fa-fw fa-xs ms-1 text-secondary" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>, which can customize the color of visited links for all websites, not just Bing&rsquo;s.

<h2 id="color-links">Color Links</h2>
<p>After that, I found <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/color-links/hiponeioelghhaljfflaaflpccedbdem/related"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">Color Links<i class="fa-solid fa-external-link-alt fa-fw fa-xs ms-1 text-secondary" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> in the chrome web store.

    <div class="details-content">
      <div class="admonition-content">Yesterday I used the texliveonfly package and got <code>env: python: No Such File or Directory</code> directly.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
<p>I tried to execute <code>python</code>, and a prompt from Xcode Command Line Tools popped up, saying that I needed to download something, and it downloaded Python3.9, while I already had Python3.8🙃.</p>

    <div class="details-content">
      <div class="admonition-content">I thought since texliveonfly was written in Python, I could edit it directly.
