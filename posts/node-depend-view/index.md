I completed this small project while learning frontend and Node.js development. It can display the dependency relationship of a project in graphical form. I also published it to npm. Please see the link above for details. I feel that it is very interesting to do full-stack development with TypeScript, and I hope to find an internship in the new year! Okay, I won&#39;t say much, come on! ðŸ’ª
