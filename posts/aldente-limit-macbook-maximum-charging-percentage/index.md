# AlDente: Limit MacBook Maximum Charging Percentage

Since the laptop uses a lithium battery, a long-term connection to the power adapter will cause the battery to always be at a high percentage, which will shorten the life of the battery. Therefore, keeping the percentage between 20% and 80% can delay the decay of the battery.

For MacBook, I found software that can solve this problem:

It can be downloaded from [Github](https://github.com/davidwernhart/AlDente/releases), or you can use Homebrew, `brew install --cask aldente`.

After launching AlDente, this software appears in the menu bar, which can easily control the maximum charging percentage of the MacBook. Afterward, it can be observed that the power adapter is connected, but the battery is not charging.
