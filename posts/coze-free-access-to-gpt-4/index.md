# Coze: Free Access to GPT-4


I recently found Coze by ByteDance, which allows free access to GPT-4 and GPT-4-Turbo!

You can refer to the [official documentation](https://www.coze.com/docs/) for specific usage methods. It supports customizing your own bot through plugins, knowledge bases, etc. In short, it&#39;s very powerful, and you can also publish the bot to platforms such as Discord, Slack, Telegram, etc.

More importantly, I found a project on Github: [coze-discord-proxy](https://github.com/deanxv/coze-discord-proxy). By handling Discord, you can proxy the Coze bot published on Discord to an OpenAI-formatted API, so you can use GPT-4 anywhere. It seems that I can save money for ChatGPT Plus!
