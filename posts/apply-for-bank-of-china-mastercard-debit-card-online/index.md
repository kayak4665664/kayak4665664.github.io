I mainly learned about this card on this blog [跨境通VISA/万事达借记卡介绍与网上支付体验](https://poplite.xyz/post/2018/03/05/boc-debit-card-guide-for-online-payment.html#3-%E7%94%B3%E5%8D%A1%E6%8C%87%E5%8D%97), thanks to the author for sharing.

There are many types of cards, but the application process is the same. I applied for the World Card. The card face is Monet&#39;s sunrise impression, which is very beautiful. I mainly introduce my handling process, and other detailed information can refer to the above blog.

## Apply Online
{{&lt; link href=&#34;https://cloud.bankofchina.com/sh/api/net/common/url/adr?id=kuajinggomastercard&#34; content=&#34;Bank of China Shanghai Branch MasterCard Application&#34; title=&#34;Bank of China Shanghai Branch MasterCard Application&#34; card=true &gt;}}

Open the above link on your phone and submit the information as required. The mailing address must be accurate to the house number, and the bank where the account is opened can be optional.

{{&lt; admonition tip &gt;}}
I encountered a problem at this step, I could not receive the verification code after filling in my phone number. I used China Mobile 和多号 to apply for a sub-number, and then I can receive the verification code with this sub-number. I found that the number that sent the verification code was `106980095566`, not the customer service hotline `95566` of the Bank of China. The number `106980095566` can be unsubscribed by sending `TD`. I guess I should have unsubscribed from the SMS service of this number before, so I couldn’t receive the verification code.

After applying, you can check the progress in the above link. If the application fails, you will also receive a text message reminder. When I applied for the first time, I wrote the address of the school, but it was not accurate to the house number, so the application failed.

If the application is approved, you can receive the bank card by EMS in about two weeks.

## Offline activation

After receiving the bank card, go to any Bank of China outlet to activate it, and you need to bring your ID card and bank card.

It can be activated at the smart counter, and the default password is the sixth to the second last digits of the ID card. The bound mobile phone number can be modified during activation, and the card will be linked to mobile banking after activation.

## After activation

After activation, the foreign currency must be transferred to the bank card, and foreign currency needs to be purchased through a Bank of China Class I card.

In addition, the online payment function must be activated in mobile banking:
- Increase the limit in &#34;限额设置 -&gt; 限额设置&#34;
- Enable &#34;限额设置 -&gt; 小额/凭签名免密(POS消费)&#34;
- Enable &#34;限额设置 -&gt; 磁条交易限额设置&#34;
- Enable &#34;支付设置 -&gt; 电子支付-手机支付&#34;
- Enable &#34;支付设置 -&gt; 电子支付-网上支付&#34;
- Enable &#34;支付设置 -&gt; 跨行支付 -&gt; 在线支付&#34;
- Enable &#34;支付设置 -&gt; 跨行支付 -&gt; 跨行代扣&#34;
- Enable &#34;支付设置 -&gt; 跨行支付 -&gt; 跨行订购&#34;

## Precautions for using the card

- Consumption or ATM cash withdrawal supports 19 foreign currencies such as US dollars, Euros, Japanese yen, and Hong Kong dollars, without currency conversion. Free of currency conversion fees, cross-border fees, and other consumption fees. The first overseas ATM cash withdrawal and balance inquiry fees are waived every month.
- Both foreign currency and foreign banknotes can be used for consumption and payment, and there will be no conversion fees when using them.
- If there is no transaction within 6 months after the debit card is opened, the non-counter business will be stopped.
- If the card is not used for a long time, the balance of the card must not be 0.
- When binding a card or making daily purchases, the balance in the USD account must be no less than $2.
- The account opening bank is the Shanghai branch. Businesses related to physical cards (such as the replacement of lost cards, replacement of expired cards, etc.) need to be handled at branches in Shanghai.
- Domestic transfers of foreign currency can only be made to the personal account and the account of the immediate family member. The foreign currency transfer between the personal non-Bank of China account and the account of the immediate family member needs to be handled at the counter.
- The payment will not be deducted immediately, but a certain proportion of funds will be frozen, and the deduction will be unfrozen after waiting for the bank to deposit the funds. The deposit time is usually two to three days. 100% of US dollar consumption is frozen, and 102% of non-US dollar consumption is frozen.
- Follow the &#34;中国银行微银行&#34; official account, bind the card, and enable account activation notifications. However, there are only notifications of deposit, not freezing notifications. SMS transaction reminders can be opened, for ¥2 per month, need to pay with a Bank of China Class I card.
- The order of deduction of foreign accounts is transaction banknotes account -&gt; transaction currency account -&gt; USD banknotes account -&gt; USD currency account. Only one foreign account can be used for full payment, and multiple accounts cannot be deducted.
- Cardless transactions only require the card number, validity period, and the last three digits of the signature area on the back, and do not require a transaction password, so the three pieces of information must be kept confidential.
- Don&#39;t verify billing address, and don&#39;t support AVS system verification.
