I arrived in Huaibei Town, Huairou District, Beijing on August 17, 2022. I visited Yanqi Lake in the afternoon. Yanqi Lake is a very big lake. There are many treesüå≥ by the lake, many boatsüõ∂ on the lake, and many people by the lake. There is also a trail leading to somewhere on the mountain by the lake. I walked on this road for a long time and felt good. Unfortunately, the road was interrupted due to constructionüöß. Later, I learned about this road and the viewing platform of UCAS is connected. I saw a lot of birdsüê¶ on the mountain by the lake. They flew on the lake and chirped on the trees by the lake. After staying in a farmhouse inn in the village next to Yanqi Lake for one night, I went to UCAS early the next morning. It rainedüåßÔ∏è all day, my clothes and shoes were soaked, but when I first arrived at school, everything felt so fresh and I was in a good moodüôÇ. With the nucleic acid test every two days, this semester started. The quality and difficulty of the courses offered by UCAS are indeed higher than those offered by NCUT, and I feel that I have gained more. In addition to class, I often ride a bicycleüö≤ around the school to see the scenery of the campus. Because the school is backed by mountains and Yanqi Lake, the ecological environment of the school is very good. There are often little animalsüê±, and it is said that there are beast of prey such as boarsüêó and snakesüêç. I have to say that UCAS has planted many fruit trees in the mountains. After the autumn harvest, we ate a lot of free fruits. At the end of November, the school became not so peaceful. As the Omicron epidemic became more serious in winter, many colleges and universities in Beijing began to arrange for students to return home. In the beginning, UCAS still required students to complete all the exams at school, and then finally allowed students to return to their hometowns on November 29. All kinds of gossip spread in the school for a while: some people said that there was a student who tested positive for nucleic acid in the school, and all the students could not go home, and they might be quarantined in the dormitory; someone said that after leaving the school and entering the urban area of Beijing, someone would search the mobile phone at the train station or other places‚Ä¶ It feels a bit panicky. Since the city where my family is located was under lockdown, I didn‚Äôt know when it would end, so I decided to stay in school. It is said that if there is an epidemic on campus, the cafeteria may not be able to cook normally, so I quickly stocked up some food. At that time, many express delivery services were interrupted, and JD Express also became very slow. During those few days, most of the students left the school and went home, and the school was quiet. Around December 5, there was a sudden major change in the epidemic prevention policy, and the nucleic acid test every two days was finally ended. But at this time, infected people began to appear in the school, and I also prepared 2 boxes of compound acetaminophen capsules. After waking up on the morning of December 19th, I felt my throat was dry and a little sore, and there was a lot of nasal discharge. I must have an infection. That night, my sports watch kept warning me my heartü´Ä was beating very fast at around 120BMP. I could hear my heart beating while sitting quietly. I was so scared and I lay down on the bed. My whole body was hot, and my heart rate still couldn‚Äôt drop. With the sound of my heart beating, I finally fell asleep. Checking the records the next morning, the heart rate slowly dropped to around 90BMP, which is very abnormal. I didn‚Äôt know what was wrong with this, since it came out in 2019, I didn‚Äôt know that the new crown virus could affect the heart.

Now that I have completed most of the work on my graduation project, these last two weeks have been relatively relax. But I am now quarantined and can only stay in the room every dayüôÉ, and today is the 4th day. At noon on May 27, I went to the canteen to have lunch as usual. As soon as I returned to my dormitory, I suddenly received a notice from the school asking graduates to leave the school as soon as possible. I realized right away that this would be my last few days at North China University of Technology. I calmed down a bit and immediately started planning what I had to do before I left school. The first thing to consider is my luggage. Fortunately, the school promised that it can be delivered for free. Otherwise, I can‚Äôt afford the cost of expressing so many things. However, I didn‚Äôt have a cardboard box for packing. I asked the counselor and he only said it would be released later. I felt his answer was too vague, and I decided to go buy a few cardboard boxes myself. I went to the school express outlet and found the boss there. He told me that our college had taken more than 100 cardboard boxes from him before. I estimated that a student should only get 1 cardboard box. So, I bought 4 large cardboard boxes from the boss for ¬•45. With the cardboard box, I went back to my dormitory to pack the luggage. At the same time, I had to report to the community where my family live. I contacted the staff in the community and she told me that I would be quarantined for 7 days and then quarantined at home for 7 days. I did‚Äôt think this is reasonable. I have took dozens of nucleic acid tests during school, and they have never been positive, and the school has always been closed. People outside the school can‚Äôt come in, and people inside the school can‚Äôt get out. I don‚Äôt think I should be quarantined for 7 days. And as far as I know, there are some places that do not require centralized quarantine for students returning from Beijing. I explained it to her, but it didn‚Äôt work. Fortunately, centralized quarantine is free, otherwise it will cost a lot of money. In those days, I saw news that some college students were quarantined after returning home and charged ¬•500 a day. After packing my luggage, I felt a little hot and I noticed that my hair was a little longer. As soon as I thought that I was going to be quarantined for half a month, I went to the barber shop to cut my hair short. In the evening, the counselor finally informed us that we could go get the cardboard box, and I got a cardboard box and a sack. With the 4 large cardboard boxes I bought, it was just right. On the morning of May 28, I went to the supermarket to buy a marker and I had to mark my address on the box. I walked into the dormitory building, and a dormitory administrator who was familiar with me told me that I could take my luggage to the express outlet now,¬†and reminded me to hurry up. Considering that I have to move 4 cartons and 1 sack from the dormitory to the outlet, it is not easy to rely on only two hands, so I went to the outlet and borrowed a flatbed trolley from the boss. I went back to my dormitory, marked all 5 items with my information, put them all on the trolley, and all of them were shipped to the express outlet at once. Since the notice of the graduates leaving the school was rushed, the boss of the express outlet frankly said that they did not know how to handle the luggage of so many students, and there were only two people in the entire outlet including him. When I pushed the flat trolley to the outlet, I saw that there were already many boxes piled up outside. I was a little worried that so many boxes would be confused, so I asked the boss to affix notes to my luggage first, so that I could also track it easily. By the time I had dealt with all this, it was already past 12 o‚Äôclock.

Since Github Pages uses Jekyll by default, I chose Jekyll. Jekyll is based on Ruby and can be installed with gem. I use macOS and Ruby is a built-in software. I directly executed gem install jekyll bundler to start installing Jekyll, Bundler and their dependencies. During the installation, fatal error:'ruby/config.h' file not found appeared. I googled it and found that some people said the version of the built-in Ruby was too low, but others said that it was a problem with Xcode CommandLineTools. I installed a new Ruby with Homebrew directly. After installation, set the environment variables in terminal, re-executed gem install jekyll bundler, and the installation was complete this time. Warning I also searched for how to clean up the cache and installed packages of the last gem install jekyll bundler, but I didn‚Äôt find it.

But there was a problem, push did not work. Google didn‚Äôt find it, but Baidu found that it may be a problem with proxy. It was resolved after unseting the proxy settings of git. Browsing with my phone, the webpage was automatically adapted to the mobile interface. At this time, I found that this theme was too simple, and it didn‚Äôt even have a pagination. At the beginning, I was planning to implement it myself, but I thought that so many functions would have to be implemented one by one, and the workload was huge.

In addition, I also used Bu Suanzi for website traffic statistics, which only requires two lines of code. Then I started to add some content. In the process of previewing the content, I gradually discovered some problems. The font of this theme was too small, and the contrast between the text and the background was low whether in light or dark mode. In short, I felt that reading it tortures my eyes. However, the font cannot be set in the configuration file. I can only modified the .scss files one by one, which is more troublesome. And its translation function called Google‚Äôs webpage translation interface, which was almost unusable under the Chinese network, causing the webpage to become stuck. I directly deleted the translation-related part of the source code. In addition, Disqus cannot log in to the account under the Chinese network. After a test, only anonymous guest comments can be used. This is also a disadvantage.

Considering that there were other shortcomings in this theme, I chose to abandon it. I started looking for the subject again, this time more carefully.

Write a complete one. Okay, I described my topic more completely, waiting for his opinion. The message has been read, but there has been no reply. It‚Äôs inexplicable, wouldn‚Äôt he forget it? The next day, I sent him a message and asked his opinion again, and suddenly received a 59 second voice message. What the adviser said: ‚Ä¶ Yous is not a È¢òÁõÆ at all, yours is just a spoken expression. How could that be a È¢òÁõÆ? And the work you will do, to be honest, is too searchable. I can‚Äôt say‚Ä¶ If I don‚Äôt see the specific content. Then what you do can be more or less.

You want to determine it, can I decide a spoken expression for you? Can it be a È¢òÁõÆ? You can‚Äôt write a È¢òÁõÆ yourself, you ask me to decide? Deciding a spoken expression for you, is appropriate? Ok? After you‚Äôve thought about it yourself, we will have a basis for discussion. Otherwise, there is nothing to say!

I can modify or improve it! He keeps not replying, can I know what he thinks? I experienced this situation for the first time since I was born, and I didn‚Äôt know what it meant to me. I also told my master tutor about this matter. The first message she replied to was: Why? I also showed her the voice of my adviser, and she helped me determine a title. Here I suddenly discovered that there may be a misunderstanding. Does the ‚ÄúÈ¢òÁõÆ‚Äù mentioned by my adviser refer to the ‚Äútitle‚Äù or the ‚Äútopic‚Äù? I checked the Modern Chinese Normative Dictionary, ‚ÄúÈ¢òÁõÆ‚Äù does have multiple meanings. He said that my ‚ÄúÈ¢òÁõÆ‚Äù was a ‚Äúspoken expression‚Äù, and it seemed that the ‚ÄúÈ¢òÁõÆ‚Äù mentioned by him refers to the ‚Äútitle‚Äù. If so, why didn‚Äôt he make it clear at the beginning that he was talking about a title? Well, he said that I can‚Äôt write a title myself, and there is no basis for discussion. Then I sent him the determined title, hoping for further discussion. However, he still has nothing to say. At that time, I felt that the ‚Äútitle‚Äù or ‚Äútopic‚Äù may not be the key. I thought of him saying in the group, ‚Äúfrom this class, the educational administration is going to start the graduation project management system‚Äù, ‚Äúall through the system‚Äù, ‚Äúleave traces‚Äù. ‚ÄúMoreover‚Äù, ‚Äúqualification for the Washington Accord is in progress‚Äù, ‚Äúadvisers strictly control the quality of topics‚Äù. I thought it may not be easy for him to check the professional level and workload of this topic. After all, he is not researching cyber security, and there should be no similar topics in the past. He has been difficult to conclude, so he has nothing to say. I told my master tutor what I thought, and she suggested that I explain it to him in more detail. Therefore, I wrote a document that was a bit like an opening report. I wrote out the specific tasks to be done, and also initially planned the time allocation for each task. I sent it to my adviser and asked him to¬†express his opinions directly¬†if¬†he had any questions. Finally, my adviser started to discuss it with me. What the adviser said: You can submit it.
