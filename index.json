[{"categories":["Note"],"content":" Abstract ChatGPT’s API is officially released and can be used in Python. Introducing ChatGPT API https://openai.com/blog/introducing-chatgpt-and-whisper-apis After registering an OpenAI account, create an API Key in https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys. You can see in https://platform.openai.com/account/usage that there is a free trial usage of $18 in the account, which expires on April 1. This time the released ChatGPT model gpt-3.5-turbo is the same as the model used in the ChatGPT product. In addition, gpt-3.5-turbo-0301 has also been released, and this model is at least supported until June 1. The complete API usage guide can be found here: ChatGPT API Usage Guide https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat In short, to use the ChatGPT API in Python, you need to install the openai Python package. # If you haven't installed openai, you can use the following command to install pip install openai # If you have installed openai, use the following command to update pip install openai --upgrade Then, import openai, and then use the openai.Completion.create function to call the API. Here is a simple Python script I wrote that can have a multi-turn conversation with ChatGPT. import os import openai # here you need to replace the API key with your own os.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = \"sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\" openai.api_key = os.getenv(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\") messages = [ {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant.\"}, ] # this function is used to call the API def get_response(messages): completion = openai.ChatCompletion.create( model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\", messages=messages, ) return completion.choices[0].message.content # type: ignore while True: try: print(\"type 'quit' to exit, type 'new' to begin a new conversation\") user_content = input(\"You: \") if user_content == \"quit\": break elif user_content == \"new\": messages = [ {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant.\"}, ] print(\"new conversation started\\n\") continue else: messages.append({\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": user_content}) response = get_response(messages) print(\"Assistant:\", response + \"\\n\") # append the response to the messages list for the next turn messages.append({\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": response}) except Exception as e: print(e) The output is as follows: Example type ‘quit’ to exit, type ’new’ to begin a new conversation You: What is the biggest animal in the world?

Moreover, the prompt “This has been lovely, but you’ve reached your daily limit. Chat again tomorrow?” appeared within a few minutes. I have to say that a very useful feature of the new Bing is that it can obtain information from the web pages and documents we are reading. I tested it, opened a local PDF file with Edge Dev, clicked the Discover button to chat, and the new Bing can summarize the main points in this file. In addition, it can also easily generate some text in Discover.

I arrived in Huaibei Town, Huairou District, Beijing on August 17, 2022. I visited Yanqi Lake in the afternoon. Yanqi Lake is a very big lake. There are many trees🌳 by the lake, many boats🛶 on the lake, and many people by the lake. There is also a trail leading to somewhere on the mountain by the lake. I walked on this road for a long time and felt good. Unfortunately, the road was interrupted due to construction🚧. Later, I learned about this road and the viewing platform of UCAS is connected. I saw a lot of birds🐦 on the mountain by the lake. They flew on the lake and chirped on the trees by the lake. Yanqi Lake After staying in a farmhouse inn in the village next to Yanqi Lake for one night, I went to UCAS early the next morning. It rained🌧️ all day, and my clothes and shoes were soaked, but when I first arrived at school, everything felt so fresh and I was in a good mood🙂. The lotus pond in the West District of Yanqi Lake Campus of UCAS The sunset Great Wall on the Hill With the nucleic acid test every two days, this semester started. The quality and difficulty of the courses offered by UCAS are indeed higher than those offered by NCUT, and I feel that I have gained more. In addition to class, I often ride a bicycle🚲 around the school to see the scenery of the campus. Because the school is backed by mountains and Yanqi Lake, the ecological environment of the school is very good. There are often little animals🐱, and it is said that there are beasts of prey such as boars🐗 and snakes🐍. Mountains in Autumn Yellow leaves Tree in sunlight Hawthorn tree Yanqi North Road I have to say that UCAS has planted many fruit trees in the mountains. After the autumn harvest, we ate a lot of free fruits. Pear In the early morning of October 15th, our entire dormitory was suddenly notified to be quarantined on the spot, and each of us was sent a hearty breakfast and a large bucket of water. Before I finished eating, We were notified again that the quarantine is over, which is inexplicable😅. Breakfast At the end of November, the school became not so peaceful. As the Omicron epidemic became more serious in winter, many colleges and universities in Beijing began to arrange for students to return home. In the beginning, UCAS still required students to complete all the exams at school, and then finally allowed students to return to their hometowns on November 29. All kinds of gossip spread in the school for a while: some people said that there was a student who tested positive for nucleic acid in the school, and all the students could not go home, and they might be quarantined in the dormitory; someone said that after leaving the school and entering the urban area of Beijing, someone would search the mobile phone at the train station or other places… It feels a bit panicky. Since the city where my family is located was under lockdown, I didn’t know when it would end, so I decided to stay in school. It is said that if there is an epidemic on campus, the cafeteria may not be able to cook normally, so I quickly stocked up some food. At that time, many express delivery services were interrupted, and JD Express also became very slow. During those few days, most of the students left the school and went home, and the school was quiet. Around December 5, there was a sudden major change in the epidemic prevention policy, and the nucleic acid test every two days was finally ended. But at this time, infected people began to appear in the school, and I also prepared 2 boxes of compound acetaminophen capsules. After waking up on the morning of December 19th, I felt my throat was dry and a little sore, and there was a lot of nasal discharge. I must have an infection.

Now that I have completed most of the work on my graduation project, these last two weeks have been relatively relaxing. But I am now quarantined and can only stay in the room every day🙃, and today is the 4th day. At noon on May 27, I went to the canteen to have lunch as usual. As soon as I returned to my dormitory, I suddenly received a notice from the school asking graduates to leave the school as soon as possible. I realized right away that this would be my last few days at the North China University of Technology. the notice I calmed down a bit and immediately started planning what I had to do before I left school. The first thing to consider is my luggage. Fortunately, the school promised that it can be delivered for free. Otherwise, I can’t afford the cost of expressing so many things. However, I didn’t have a cardboard box for packing. I asked the counselor and he only said it would be released later. I felt his answer was too vague, and I decided to go buy a few cardboard boxes myself. I went to the school express outlet and found the boss there. He told me that our college had taken more than 100 cardboard boxes from him before. I estimated that a student should only get 1 cardboard box. So, I bought 4 large cardboard boxes from the boss for ¥45. With the cardboard box, I went back to my dormitory to pack the luggage. At the same time, I had to report to the community where my family live. I contacted the staff in the community and she told me that I would be quarantined for 7 days and then quarantined at home for 7 days. I didn’t think this is reasonable. I have taken dozens of nucleic acid tests during school, and they have never been positive, and the school has always been closed. People outside the school can’t come in, and people inside the school can’t get out. I don’t think I should be quarantined for 7 days. And as far as I know, some places do not require centralized quarantine for students returning from Beijing. I explained it to her, but it didn’t work. Fortunately, centralized quarantine is free, otherwise, it will cost a lot of money. In those days, I saw the news that some college students were quarantined after returning home and charged ¥500 a day. After packing my luggage, I felt a little hot and I noticed that my hair was a little longer. As soon as I thought that I was going to be quarantined for half a month, I went to the barber shop to cut my hair short. In the evening, the counselor finally informed us that we could go get the cardboard box, and I got a cardboard box and a sack. With the 4 large cardboard boxes I bought, it was just right. On the morning of May 28, I went to the supermarket to buy a marker and I had to mark my address on the box. I walked into the dormitory building, and a dormitory administrator who was familiar with me told me that I could take my luggage to the express outlet now, and reminded me to hurry up. Considering that I have to move 4 cartons and 1 sack from the dormitory to the outlet, it is not easy to rely on only two hands, so I went to the outlet and borrowed a flatbed trolley from the boss. I went back to my dormitory, marked all 5 items with my information, put them all on the trolley, and all of them were shipped to the express outlet at once. the flatbed trolley Since the notice of the graduates leaving the school was rushed, the boss of the express outlet frankly said that they did not know how to handle the luggage of so many students, and there were only two people in the entire outlet including him. When I pushed the flat trolley to the outlet, I saw that there were already many boxes piled up outside. I was a little worried that so many boxes would be confused, so I asked the boss to affix notes to my luggage first so that I could also track it easily. By the time I had dealt with all this, it was already past noon.

Finally, I found the LoveIt theme, which is what I use now. This is a theme based on Hugo, so Ruby was useless, I uninstalled it.

In addition, I built a private repository for synchronizing source code other than /public, so every deployment needs to be synchronized once more. To automate these three processes, I wrote a Shell script. Only one step. At this time, my domain finally passed the real-name verification.

After all, the graduation project is not so casual. My adviser posted some reference topics in the group, all of which are quite classic. However, that topic is very new to me.

Write a complete one. Okay, I described my topic more completely, waiting for his opinion. The message has been read, but there has been no reply. It’s inexplicable, wouldn’t he forget it? The next day, I sent him a message and asked his opinion again, and suddenly received a 59-second voice message. What the adviser said: … Yous is not a 题目 at all, yours is just a spoken expression. How could that be a 题目? And the work you will do, to be honest, is too searchable. I can’t say… If I don’t see the specific content. Then what you do can be more or less. The requirements for you, I don’t know… If it’s low, it’s very simple and not too difficult; if it’s high, that’s a certain degree of difficulty, okay? Then you wrote so much, how could yours be a 题目? Yours is Just a Spoken Expression! Your spoken expression, how can I decide for you? You want to determine it, can I decide on a spoken expression for you? Can it be a 题目? You can’t write a 题目 yourself, you ask me to decide? Deciding a spoken expression for you, is appropriate? Ok? After you’ve thought about it yourself, we will have a basis for discussion. Otherwise, there is nothing to say! I was stunned, he said mine is not a topic. Regardless of whether it is a topic or not, if he thinks mine is not a topic and he has opinions or questions, couldn’t he tell me directly? I can modify or improve it! He keeps not replying, can I know what he thinks? I experienced this situation for the first time since I was born, and I didn’t know what it meant to me. I also told my master tutor about this matter. The first message she replied to was: Why? I also showed her the voice of my adviser, and she helped me determine a title. Here I suddenly discovered that there may be a misunderstanding. Does the “题目” mentioned by my adviser refer to the “title” or the “topic”? I checked the Modern Chinese Normative Dictionary, and “题目” does have multiple meanings. He said that my “题目” was a “spoken expression”, and it seemed that the “题目” mentioned by him refers to the “title”. If so, why didn’t he make it clear at the beginning that he was talking about a title? Well, he said that I can’t write a title myself, and there is no basis for discussion. Then I sent him the determined title, hoping for further discussion. However, he still has nothing to say. At that time, I felt that the “title” or “topic” may not be the key. I thought of him saying in the group, “from this class, the educational administration is going to start the graduation project management system”, “all through the system”, and “leave traces”. “Moreover”, “qualification for the Washington Accord is in progress”, and “advisers strictly control the quality of topics”. I thought it may not be easy for him to check the professional level and workload of this topic. After all, he is not researching cyber security, and there should be no similar topics in the past. He has been difficult to conclude, so he has nothing to say. I told my master tutor what I thought, and she suggested that I explain it to him in more detail. Therefore, I wrote a document that was a bit like an opening report. I wrote out the specific tasks to be done, and also initially planned the time allocation for each task. I sent it to my adviser and asked him to express his opinions directly if he had any questions. Finally, my adviser started to discuss it with me. What the adviser said: You can submit it.
