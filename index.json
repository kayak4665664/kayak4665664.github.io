[{"categories":["Journal"],"content":"The graduation project is finally coming to an end, and the final defense will be held on the afternoon of June 9! Now that I have completed most of the work on my graduation project, these last two weeks have been relatively relax. But I am now quarantined and can only stay in the room every dayüôÉ, and today is the 4th day. At noon on May 27, I went to the canteen to have lunch as usual. As soon as I returned to my dormitory, I suddenly received a notice from the school asking graduates to leave the school as soon as possible. I realized right away that this would be my last few days at North China University of Technology. I calmed down a bit and immediately started planning what I had to do before I left school. The first thing to consider is my luggage. Fortunately, the school promised that it can be delivered for free. Otherwise, I can‚Äôt afford the cost of expressing so many things. However, I didn‚Äôt have a cardboard box for packing. I asked the counselor and he only said it would be released later. I felt his answer was too vague, and I decided to go buy a few cardboard boxes myself. I went to the school express outlet and found the boss there. He told me that our college had taken more than 100 cardboard boxes from him before. I estimated that a student should only get 1 cardboard box. So, I bought 4 large cardboard boxes from the boss for ¬•45. With the cardboard box, I went back to my dormitory to pack the luggage. At the same time, I had to report to the community where my family live. I contacted the staff in the community and she told me that I would be quarantined for 7 days and then quarantined at home for 7 days. I did‚Äôt think this is reasonable. I have took dozens of nucleic acid tests during school, and they have never been positive, and the school has always been closed. People outside the school can‚Äôt come in, and people inside the school can‚Äôt get out. I don‚Äôt think I should be quarantined for 7 days. And as far as I know, there are some places that do not require centralized quarantine for students returning from Beijing. I explained it to her, but it didn‚Äôt work. Fortunately, centralized quarantine is free, otherwise it will cost a lot of money. In those days, I saw news that some college students were quarantined after returning home and charged ¬•500 a day. After packing my luggage, I felt a little hot and I noticed that my hair was a little longer. As soon as I thought that I was going to be quarantined for half a month, I went to the barber shop to cut my hair short. In the evening, the counselor finally informed us that we could go get the cardboard box, and I got a cardboard box and a sack. With the 4 large cardboard boxes I bought, it was just right. On the morning of May 28, I went to the supermarket to buy a marker and I had to mark my address on the box. I walked into the dormitory building, and a dormitory administrator who was familiar with me told me that I could take my luggage to the express outlet now,¬†and reminded me to hurry up. Considering that I have to move 4 cartons and 1 sack from the dormitory to the outlet, it is not easy to rely on only two hands, so I went to the outlet and borrowed a flatbed trolley from the boss. I went back to my dormitory, marked all 5 items with my information, put them all on the trolley, and all of them were shipped to the express outlet at once. Since the notice of the graduates leaving the school was rushed, the boss of the express outlet frankly said that they did not know how to handle the luggage of so many students, and there were only two people in the entire outlet including him. When I pushed the flat trolley to the outlet, I saw that there were already many boxes piled up outside. I was a little worried that so many boxes would be confused, so I asked the boss to affix notes to my luggage first, so that I could also track it easily. By the time I had dealt with all this, it was already past 12 o‚Äôclock.

Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

It is said that Baidu will not index sites hosted by Github Pages, and it can be indexed after being deployed to Vercel Set a custom domain in Vercel Added Baidu Tongji and Google Analytics Submitted the sitemap to Baidu Ziyuan and Google Search Console, in Bing Webmaster Tools directly imported the submitted sitemap in Google Search Console ","date":"2021-12-22","objectID":"/how-my-wesite-was-built/:3:3","tags":["My Website","Github Pages","Jekyll","Hugo"],"title":"How My Wesite Was Built?","uri":"/how-my-wesite-was-built/"},{"categories":["Note"],"content":"End In the future, I also plan to add a little Google advertisement, which is also a feature of most websites.

After all, the graduation project is not so casual. My adviser posted some reference topics in the group, all of which are quite classic. However, that topic is very new to me. I have never worked in this field before. In general, I prefer the topic of cyber security, and my master tutor also hopes that I will complete this topic very well. So I reported it to my adviser. ","date":"2021-12-18","objectID":"/graduation-project-starts-now/:3:0","tags":["graduation project"],"title":"Graduation Project Starts Now","uri":"/graduation-project-starts-now/"},{"categories":["Journal"],"content":"Discussion What the adviser said: The È¢òÁõÆ (t√≠m√π, It means ‚Äútitle‚Äù or ‚Äútopic‚Äù in Chinese.) is incomplete. Write a complete one. Okay, I described my topic more completely, waiting for his opinion. The message has been read, but there has been no reply. It‚Äôs inexplicable, wouldn‚Äôt he forget it? The next day, I sent him a message and asked his opinion again, and suddenly received a 59 second voice message. What the adviser said: ‚Ä¶ Yous is not a È¢òÁõÆ at all, yours is just a spoken expression. How could that be a È¢òÁõÆ? And the work you will do, to be honest, is too searchable. I can‚Äôt say‚Ä¶ If I don‚Äôt see the specific content. Then what you do can be more or less. The requirements for you, I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ If it‚Äôs low, it‚Äôs very simple and not too difficult; if it‚Äôs high, that‚Äôs a certain degree of difficulty, okay? Then you wrote so much, how could yours be a È¢òÁõÆ? Yours is Just a Spoken Expression! Your spoken expression, how can I decide for you? You want to determine it, can I decide a spoken expression for you? Can it be a È¢òÁõÆ? You can‚Äôt write a È¢òÁõÆ yourself, you ask me to decide? Deciding a spoken expression for you, is appropriate? Ok? After you‚Äôve thought about it yourself, we will have a basis for discussion. Otherwise, there is nothing to say! I was stunned, he said mine is not a topic. Regardless of whether it is a topic or not, if he thinks mine is not a topic and¬†he has opinions or questions, couldn‚Äôt he tell me directly? I can modify or improve it! He keeps not replying, can I know what he thinks? I experienced this situation for the first time since I was born, and I didn‚Äôt know what it meant to me. I also told my master tutor about this matter. The first message she replied to was: Why? I also showed her the voice of my adviser, and she helped me determine a title. Here I suddenly discovered that there may be a misunderstanding. Does the ‚ÄúÈ¢òÁõÆ‚Äù mentioned by my adviser refer to the ‚Äútitle‚Äù or the ‚Äútopic‚Äù? I checked the Modern Chinese Normative Dictionary, ‚ÄúÈ¢òÁõÆ‚Äù does have multiple meanings. He said that my ‚ÄúÈ¢òÁõÆ‚Äù was a ‚Äúspoken expression‚Äù, and it seemed that the ‚ÄúÈ¢òÁõÆ‚Äù mentioned by him refers to the ‚Äútitle‚Äù. If so, why didn‚Äôt he make it clear at the beginning that he was talking about a title? Well, he said that I can‚Äôt write a title myself, and there is no basis for discussion. Then I sent him the determined title, hoping for further discussion. However, he still has nothing to say. At that time, I felt that the ‚Äútitle‚Äù or ‚Äútopic‚Äù may not be the key. I thought of him saying in the group, ‚Äúfrom this class, the educational administration is going to start the graduation project management system‚Äù, ‚Äúall through the system‚Äù, ‚Äúleave traces‚Äù. ‚ÄúMoreover‚Äù, ‚Äúqualification for the Washington Accord is in progress‚Äù, ‚Äúadvisers strictly control the quality of topics‚Äù. I thought it may not be easy for him to check the professional level and workload of this topic. After all, he is not researching cyber security, and there should be no similar topics in the past. He has been difficult to conclude, so he has nothing to say. I told my master tutor what I thought, and she suggested that I explain it to him in more detail. Therefore, I wrote a document that was a bit like an opening report. I wrote out the specific tasks to be done, and also initially planned the time allocation for each task. I sent it to my adviser and asked him to¬†express his opinions directly¬†if¬†he had any questions. Finally, my adviser started to discuss it with me. What the adviser said: You can submit it.
