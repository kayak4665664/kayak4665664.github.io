Other methods include using Xcode, i4Tools, or external devices, or even simulating satellite signals to deceive the iPhone. I think these methods are too complicated.

I am in Beijing, and I heard that Panjiayuan (Beijing Glasses City) had very cheap glasses, so I went there. I saw photochromic glasses somewhere before, which can change color according to the intensity of ultraviolet rays. I decided to get a pair of photochromic glasses this time. I checked on the Internet, everyone said that Zeiss and Essilor lenses are better, I compared them, and finally decided to buy a pair of Zeiss PhotoFusion X lenses. My degree should be within 800 degrees, so I can choose a lens with a refractive index of 1.6. I saw a strategy saying that it is cheaper to get glasses online. Go to the optometry first, then go to the physical store to try on the frame, write down the frame model, then buy the frame online, and then send the frame and optometry to the merchant who sells the lens, and the merchant mails it later after processing. I think this method has too many links, and I especially don’t like to wait for express delivery, so I decided to go to Panjiayuan to have a look. It is said on the Internet that the water in Panjiayuan is very deep. I saw a lot of strategies on Zhihu and Xiaohongshu, and I was confused. Later, I felt that most of these were soft advertisements, so I might as well not read them. I think as long as the price is not higher than the online price, the lens is not fake, and the frame is suitable, it will be fine. Another point is that everyone said not to have optometry in Panjiayuan’s shop, the result is not very accurate. It is best to go to Beijing Tongren Optometry Center, but you need to make an appointment in advance. When I made an appointment, it was already full. I made an appointment to go to Baodao Optical for optometry. Baodao Optical is a national chain and is relatively professional. The Yanqi Lake Campus of UCAS is too far away from downtown Beijing. Fortunately, the school has a daily shuttle bus. Saturday is relatively free, I booked the shuttle bus for 7 am on Saturday. It was the first time I took a shuttle bus to the city. I didn’t expect so many people to enter the city on Saturday. When I arrived at the station, the bus was already full, and when I got on the second bus, there were only four or five seats left. It took less than an hour to get to the drop-off point at the Olympic Village, and it was the first time I entered the city since school started in February. I immediately got on the subway again and went to Baodao Optical for optometry first. After getting off the subway and walking slowly, it was exactly 9 o’clock, and there was no customer in the store. Register a member for free, and the “exquisite optometry” service can be discounted by 10 yuan to 50 yuan. Afterward, optometry began, and about 3 kinds of instruments were used, which took more than ten minutes. The optometrist told me that the result is that the left and right eyes are more than 600 degrees, and both have about 100 degrees of astigmatism. Fortunately, it’s about the same as before I went to college. I tried it on with glasses, and it felt good. The optometry results of Baodao Glasses can be checked directly in the WeChat public account, which is very convenient. The optometrist also said that if you often see close-ups, it is best not to wear glasses corrected to 1.0. 0.8 and 0.9 are fine. According to the results of my optometry, I do need a pair of photochromic glasses. After coming out of Baodao Glasses, I went straight to the bus station and rushed to Panjiayuan. It was about 10 o’clock when I arrived at the station. As said on the Internet, many people solicited customers when I got off the bus. On the overpass, the opposite is Beijing Glasses City. As soon as I entered the gate, there were all optical shops. It was said on the Internet that the higher the floor, the cheaper the optical shops, so I went upstairs directly.

Info The source code involved in this article is in the GitHub repository: Pcap-Parser https://github.com/kayak4665664/Pcap-Parser The Pcap file contains the information of the network data packet, including source IP address, destination IP address, source port, destination port, transport layer protocol, application layer protocol, etc. Therefore, the idea of the program is to parse from the data link layer to the application layer and parse out the protocol type and protocol data of each layer. In terms of implementation, you can refer to the analysis results of Wireshark. For C/C++, \u003cpcap.h\u003e can be used to process Pcap files. Afterward, use \u003cnet/ethernet.h\u003e, \u003cnetinet/ip.h\u003e, \u003cnetinet/tcp.h\u003e defined the Ethernet header, IP header, and TCP header structure to parse the data Link layer, network layer, and transport layer. In addition, both the IP header and the TCP header have options, which is not in the structure. There are many types of protocols in the application layer, and programs need to be written for each protocol. My program supports parsing HTTP and TLS protocols. HTTP is a plain text protocol, and the data fields are separated by \\r\\n. In addition, it is necessary to consider that an HTTP message is divided into several packets, and the correct result can only be parsed after reassembling the relevant packets. And TLS is an encryption protocol, which is more complicated. It needs to be parsed according to the structure of the protocol, and reassembling should also be considered. The above are just some simple ideas. There are many complicated situations that have not been covered.

On the macOS device, open Charles and set up a proxy server. The proxy server port is 8888 by default. On the iPhone, set the proxy server to the macOS device. The proxy server port is 8888. Access chls.pro/ssl in the iPhone browser, download and install the certificate. Trust the certificate in the iPhone settings General -\u003e About -\u003e Certificate Trust Settings. Install the configuration file for the proxy server in the iPhone settings General -\u003e VPN \u0026 Device Management. Since Charles can only capture HTTP and HTTPS packets, start Wireshark on the macOS device and select the Wi-Fi interface to capture packets of all protocols. Open the mobile app on the iPhone and use it. Stop capturing packets in Wireshark. The previously set proxy server port is 8888, so you can filter irrelevant data packets through tcp.port == 8888, and save the filtered packets as a pcap file.

Tip I encountered a problem at this step, I could not receive the verification code after filling in my phone number. I used China Mobile 和多号 to apply for a sub-number, and then I can receive the verification code with this sub-number. I found that the number that sent the verification code was 106980095566, not the customer service hotline 95566 of the Bank of China. The number 106980095566 can be unsubscribed by sending TD. I guess I should have unsubscribed from the SMS service of this number before, so I couldn’t receive the verification code. After applying, you can check the progress in the above link. If the application fails, you will also receive a text message reminder. When I applied for the first time, I wrote the address of the school, but it was not accurate to the house number, so the application failed.

Both foreign currency and foreign banknotes can be used for consumption and payment, and there will be no conversion fees when using them. If there is no transaction within 6 months after the debit card is opened, the non-counter business will be stopped. If the card is not used for a long time, the balance of the card must not be 0. When binding a card or making daily purchases, the balance in the USD account must be no less than $2. The account opening bank is the Shanghai branch. Businesses related to physical cards (such as the replacement of lost cards, replacement of expired cards, etc.) need to be handled at branches in Shanghai. Domestic transfers of foreign currency can only be made to the personal account and the account of the immediate family member. The foreign currency transfer between the personal non-Bank of China account and the account of the immediate family member needs to be handled at the counter. The payment will not be deducted immediately, but a certain proportion of funds will be frozen, and the deduction will be unfrozen after waiting for the bank to deposit the funds. The deposit time is usually two to three days. 100% of US dollar consumption is frozen, and 102% of non-US dollar consumption is frozen.

I arrived in Huaibei Town, Huairou District, Beijing on August 17, 2022. I visited Yanqi Lake in the afternoon. Yanqi Lake is a very big lake. There are many trees🌳 by the lake, many boats🛶 on the lake, and many people by the lake. There is also a trail leading to somewhere on the mountain by the lake. I walked on this road for a long time and felt good. Unfortunately, the road was interrupted due to construction🚧. Later, I learned about this road and the viewing platform of UCAS is connected. I saw a lot of birds🐦 on the mountain by the lake. They flew on the lake and chirped on the trees by the lake. Yanqi Lake After staying in a farmhouse inn in the village next to Yanqi Lake for one night, I went to UCAS early the next morning. It rained🌧️ all day, and my clothes and shoes were soaked, but when I first arrived at school, everything felt so fresh and I was in a good mood🙂. The lotus pond in the West District of Yanqi Lake Campus of UCAS The sunset Great Wall on the Hill With the nucleic acid test every two days, this semester started. The quality and difficulty of the courses offered by UCAS are indeed higher than those offered by NCUT, and I feel that I have gained more. In addition to class, I often ride a bicycle🚲 around the school to see the scenery of the campus. Because the school is backed by mountains and Yanqi Lake, the ecological environment of the school is very good. There are often little animals🐱, and it is said that there are beasts of prey such as boars🐗 and snakes🐍. Mountains in Autumn Yellow leaves Tree in sunlight Hawthorn tree Yanqi North Road I have to say that UCAS has planted many fruit trees in the mountains. After the autumn harvest, we ate a lot of free fruits. Pear In the early morning of October 15th, our entire dormitory was suddenly notified to be quarantined on the spot, and each of us was sent a hearty breakfast and a large bucket of water. Before I finished eating, We were notified again that the quarantine is over, which is inexplicable😅. Breakfast At the end of November, the school became not so peaceful. As the Omicron epidemic became more serious in winter, many colleges and universities in Beijing began to arrange for students to return home. In the beginning, UCAS still required students to complete all the exams at school, and then finally allowed students to return to their hometowns on November 29. All kinds of gossip spread in the school for a while: some people said that there was a student who tested positive for nucleic acid in the school, and all the students could not go home, and they might be quarantined in the dormitory; someone said that after leaving the school and entering the urban area of Beijing, someone would search the mobile phone at the train station or other places… It feels a bit panicky. Since the city where my family is located was under lockdown, I didn’t know when it would end, so I decided to stay in school. It is said that if there is an epidemic on campus, the cafeteria may not be able to cook normally, so I quickly stocked up some food. At that time, many express delivery services were interrupted, and JD Express also became very slow. During those few days, most of the students left the school and went home, and the school was quiet. Around December 5, there was a sudden major change in the epidemic prevention policy, and the nucleic acid test every two days was finally ended. But at this time, infected people began to appear in the school, and I also prepared 2 boxes of compound acetaminophen capsules. After waking up on the morning of December 19th, I felt my throat was dry and a little sore, and there was a lot of nasal discharge. I must have an infection.

Now that I have completed most of the work on my graduation project, these last two weeks have been relatively relaxing. But I am now quarantined and can only stay in the room every day🙃, and today is the 4th day. At noon on May 27, I went to the canteen to have lunch as usual. As soon as I returned to my dormitory, I suddenly received a notice from the school asking graduates to leave the school as soon as possible. I realized right away that this would be my last few days at the North China University of Technology. the notice I calmed down a bit and immediately started planning what I had to do before I left school. The first thing to consider is my luggage. Fortunately, the school promised that it can be delivered for free. Otherwise, I can’t afford the cost of expressing so many things. However, I didn’t have a cardboard box for packing. I asked the counselor and he only said it would be released later. I felt his answer was too vague, and I decided to go buy a few cardboard boxes myself. I went to the school express outlet and found the boss there. He told me that our college had taken more than 100 cardboard boxes from him before. I estimated that a student should only get 1 cardboard box. So, I bought 4 large cardboard boxes from the boss for ¥45. With the cardboard box, I went back to my dormitory to pack the luggage. At the same time, I had to report to the community where my family live. I contacted the staff in the community and she told me that I would be quarantined for 7 days and then quarantined at home for 7 days. I didn’t think this is reasonable. I have taken dozens of nucleic acid tests during school, and they have never been positive, and the school has always been closed. People outside the school can’t come in, and people inside the school can’t get out. I don’t think I should be quarantined for 7 days. And as far as I know, some places do not require centralized quarantine for students returning from Beijing. I explained it to her, but it didn’t work. Fortunately, centralized quarantine is free, otherwise, it will cost a lot of money. In those days, I saw the news that some college students were quarantined after returning home and charged ¥500 a day. After packing my luggage, I felt a little hot and I noticed that my hair was a little longer. As soon as I thought that I was going to be quarantined for half a month, I went to the barber shop to cut my hair short. In the evening, the counselor finally informed us that we could go get the cardboard box, and I got a cardboard box and a sack. With the 4 large cardboard boxes I bought, it was just right. On the morning of May 28, I went to the supermarket to buy a marker and I had to mark my address on the box. I walked into the dormitory building, and a dormitory administrator who was familiar with me told me that I could take my luggage to the express outlet now, and reminded me to hurry up. Considering that I have to move 4 cartons and 1 sack from the dormitory to the outlet, it is not easy to rely on only two hands, so I went to the outlet and borrowed a flatbed trolley from the boss. I went back to my dormitory, marked all 5 items with my information, put them all on the trolley, and all of them were shipped to the express outlet at once. the flatbed trolley Since the notice of the graduates leaving the school was rushed, the boss of the express outlet frankly said that they did not know how to handle the luggage of so many students, and there were only two people in the entire outlet including him. When I pushed the flat trolley to the outlet, I saw that there were already many boxes piled up outside. I was a little worried that so many boxes would be confused, so I asked the boss to affix notes to my luggage first so that I could also track it easily.

Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

I have never worked in this field before. In general, I prefer the topic of Iots, and the tutor in the group also hopes that I will complete this topic very well. So I reported it to my adviser.

Write a complete one. Okay, I described my topic more completely, waiting for his opinion. The message has been read, but there has been no reply. It’s inexplicable, wouldn’t he forget it? The next day, I sent him a message and asked his opinion again, and suddenly received a 59-second voice message. What the adviser said: … Yous is not a 题目 at all, yours is just a spoken expression. How could that be a 题目? And the work you will do, to be honest, is too searchable. I can’t say… If I don’t see the specific content. Then what you do can be more or less. The requirements for you, I don’t know… If it’s low, it’s very simple and not too difficult; if it’s high, that’s a certain degree of difficulty, okay? Then you wrote so much, how could yours be a 题目? Yours is Just a Spoken Expression! Your spoken expression, how can I decide for you? You want to determine it, can I decide on a spoken expression for you? Can it be a 题目? You can’t write a 题目 yourself, you ask me to decide? Deciding a spoken expression for you, is appropriate? Ok? After you’ve thought about it yourself, we will have a basis for discussion. Otherwise, there is nothing to say! I was stunned, he said mine is not a topic. Regardless of whether it is a topic or not, if he thinks mine is not a topic and he has opinions or questions, couldn’t he tell me directly? I can modify or improve it! He keeps not replying, can I know what he thinks? I experienced this situation for the first time since I was born, and I didn’t know what it meant to me. I also told my master tutor about this matter. The first message she replied to was: Why? I also showed her the voice of my adviser, and she helped me determine a title. Here I suddenly discovered that there may be a misunderstanding. Does the “题目” mentioned by my adviser refer to the “title” or the “topic”? I checked the Modern Chinese Normative Dictionary, and “题目” does have multiple meanings. He said that my “题目” was a “spoken expression”, and it seemed that the “题目” mentioned by him refers to the “title”. If so, why didn’t he make it clear at the beginning that he was talking about a title? Well, he said that I can’t write a title myself, and there is no basis for discussion. Then I sent him the determined title, hoping for further discussion. However, he still has nothing to say. At that time, I felt that the “title” or “topic” may not be the key. I thought of him saying in the group, “from this class, the educational administration is going to start the graduation project management system”, “all through the system”, and “leave traces”. “Moreover”, “qualification for the Washington Accord is in progress”, and “advisers strictly control the quality of topics”. I thought it may not be easy for him to check the professional level and workload of this topic. After all, he is not researching Iots, and there should be no similar topics in the past. He has been difficult to conclude, so he has nothing to say. I told the tutor int the group what I thought, and she suggested that I explain it to him in more detail. Therefore, I wrote a document that was a bit like an opening report. I wrote out the specific tasks to be done, and also initially planned the time allocation for each task. I sent it to my adviser and asked him to express his opinions directly if he had any questions. Finally, my adviser started to discuss it with me. What the adviser said: You can submit it.
