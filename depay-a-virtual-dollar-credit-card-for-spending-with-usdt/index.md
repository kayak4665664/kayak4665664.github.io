Android can directly download the APK and install it; iOS can be downloaded in non-Chinese regions App Store, or a beta version can be downloaded.

## Apply for a virtual card

After entering the Depay App, click Apply for a card. At the beginning, you can choose a standard card and a Lite card. The Lite card does not require KYC. Now there are 5 types of cards (Lite, Standard, Premium, Platinum, Black Gold). The difference is mainly in the card opening fee, monthly fee and recharge fee. The standard card opening fee is 0, the specific difference can be found on the [official website](https://depay.one/en-us/rights.html).

## Deposit, convert USD, recharge and activate

Depay currently supports charging USDT (TRC20), at least 5 USDT at a time. USDT can be exchanged for USD in real time after deposit. To activate the virtual card, you need to recharge the card with US dollars. There will be a certain percentage of handling fee for the recharging. The handling fee for the standard card is at least 1 US dollar each time, so do not recharge frequently in small amounts.

After activation, you can view the card number and CVV security code.

## Black Gold Card

At present, as long as you invite 20 people to open a card, you can ask the administrator to upgrade the black gold card. The black gold card has no monthly fee, and the recharge fee is relatively low.

## Is Depay safe?

Depay is a newly established small British company. If you are worried, it is best not to charge too much money, just enough.
