# Battery: Battery Charge Limiter for Apple Silicon Macbook Devices

Today I found a command line tool that can limit the battery charging of Apple Silicon Macbook, called **battery**.
&lt;!--more--&gt;

{{&lt; link href=&#34;https://github.com/actuallymentor/battery&#34; content=&#34;battery&#34; title=&#34;battery&#34; card=true &gt;}}

I have been using [AlDente](https://www.kayak4665664.com/aldente-limit-macbook-maximum-charging-percentage/) before. Compared with it, the advantage of **battery** is that it can be used directly on the command line, and it is completely free, while AlDente can only use the most basic functions without paying, and its icon occupies a spot in the menu bar.

Just one line of command:

``` bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/actuallymentor/battery/main/setup.sh | bash
```

After the installation is complete, you can use `battery help` to view help information, it&#39;s so easy.
