  <title>Go to Panjiayuan to Get Glasses</title>
  <link>https://www.kayak4665664.com/go-to-panjiayuan-to-get-glasses/</link>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>My current glasses were bought before I went to college, and I can&rsquo;t see clearly anymore. I am in Beijing, and I heard that Panjiayuan (Beijing Glasses City) had very cheap glasses, so I went there.</p>
<p>I saw photochromic glasses somewhere before, which can change color according to the intensity of ultraviolet rays. I decided to get a pair of photochromic glasses this time. I checked on the Internet, everyone said that Zeiss and Essilor lenses are better, I compared them, and finally decided to buy a pair of Zeiss PhotoFusion X lenses. My degree should be within 800 degrees, so I can choose a lens with a refractive index of 1.6.</p>
<p>I saw a strategy saying that it is cheaper to get glasses online. Go to the optometry first, then go to the physical store to try on the frame, write down the frame model, then buy the frame online, and then send the frame and optometry to the merchant who sells the lens, and the merchant mails it later after processing. I think this method has too many links, and I especially don&rsquo;t like to wait for express delivery, so I decided to go to Panjiayuan to have a look. It is said on the Internet that the water in Panjiayuan is very deep. I saw a lot of strategies on Zhihu and Xiaohongshu, and I was confused. Later, I felt that most of these were soft advertisements, so I might as well not read them. I think as long as the price is not higher than the online price, the lens is not fake, and the frame is suitable, it will be fine.</p>
<p>Another point is that everyone said not to have optometry in Panjiayuan&rsquo;s shop, the result is not very accurate. It is best to go to Beijing Tongren Optometry Center, but you need to make an appointment in advance. When I made an appointment, it was already full. I made an appointment to go to Baodao Optical for optometry. Baodao Optical is a national chain and is relatively professional.</p>
<p>The Yanqi Lake Campus of UCAS is too far away from downtown Beijing. Fortunately, the school has a daily shuttle bus. Saturday is relatively free, I booked the shuttle bus for 7 am on Saturday. It was the first time I took a shuttle bus to the city. I didn’t expect so many people to enter the city on Saturday. When I arrived at the station, the bus was already full, and when I got on the second bus, there were only four or five seats left. It took less than an hour to get to the drop-off point at the Olympic Village, and it was the first time I entered the city since school started in February.</p>
<p>I immediately got on the subway again and went to Baodao Optical for optometry first. After getting off the subway and walking slowly, it was exactly 9 o&rsquo;clock, and there was no customer in the store. Register a member for free, and the &ldquo;exquisite optometry&rdquo; service can be discounted by 10 yuan to 50 yuan. Afterward, optometry began, and about 3 kinds of instruments were used, which took more than ten minutes. The optometrist told me that the result is that the left and right eyes are more than 600 degrees, and both have about 100 degrees of astigmatism. Fortunately, it&rsquo;s about the same as before I went to college. I tried it on with glasses, and it felt good. The optometry results of Baodao Glasses can be checked directly in the WeChat public account, which is very convenient. The optometrist also said that if you often see close-ups, it is best not to wear glasses corrected to 1.0. 0.8 and 0.9 are fine. According to the results of my optometry, I do need a pair of photochromic glasses.</p>
<p>After coming out of Baodao Glasses, I went straight to the bus station and rushed to Panjiayuan. It was about 10 o&rsquo;clock when I arrived at the station. As said on the Internet, many people solicited customers when I got off the bus. On the overpass, the opposite is Beijing Glasses City. As soon as I entered the gate, there were all optical shops. It was said on the Internet that the higher the floor, the cheaper the optical shops, so I went upstairs directly. I turned around on the third and fourth floors, not knowing whose shop to enter. I saw a few online celebrity shops, and there are indeed more customers than ordinary shops.</p>
<p>I went down to the second floor, and this time I decided that I would go into whichever store solicited me. When I entered the first store, I told the boss directly that I want the PhotoFusion X lens. The boss took out a ZEISS product manual and began to search for it. After searching for a long time, he couldn’t find it. I saw that his product manual was from last year, and PhotoFusion X was newly released, so it should indeed not be in it. The same thing happened with the second one. I looked at a few more, but none of them had the lenses I wanted. I wondered if there were none, so I decided to look at a few more and go back and buy online if there are none.</p>
<p>I went into another store, and the owner of this store was an aunt with a Southern accent. She said her product manual was from this year and should be available. After looking through the booklet, I found it. I asked her how much it was, and she pulled out her calculator and multiplied the list price by a discount factor. Panjiayuan&rsquo;s optical shops generally offer 30 to 40 percent off the price, and the owner of each shop has a calculator that looks similar. She gave a price, but it was much higher than the one on the Internet. I started to bargain with her, and finally, I showed her the price of lenses in the Jingdong shopping cart, and finally pressed the price down, and the lens and frame were all-inclusive at 1,000 yuan. After that, I started to choose frames, took out more than a dozen and tried them one by one, and probably selected a few. I reconfirmed the model specification of the lens with her. At this time, I realized that I was wrong just now. I saw a different model just now, which was not the same. She also said that I can&rsquo;t get the model I want for 1,000 yuan, but I just showed her the lens I want in the Jingdong shopping cart and I can get it for 1,000 yuan. In short, it was another round of haggling. I think this is a waste of time. I told her that if she can&rsquo;t reduce the price, I will go to other stores. She let go when she saw that I was going to leave, and she quickly asked me to give her the optometry results, but at this time I didn&rsquo;t want to get glasses at her shop. I asked her when I could get the glasses, and she said that it would take at least 5 to 7 days for custom lenses, and I thought they could be taken away on the spot in the physical store. I asked her if the ordinary lenses could be taken away on the spot, and she told me to wait for an hour, and she strongly recommended that I buy ordinary lenses. It can be seen that she is not familiar with photochromic lenses. In general, I don&rsquo;t think the experience of this store is very good, so I decided to try other stores. But the boss was still very enthusiastic about letting me buy ordinary lenses. I looked at my watch and saw that it was past 11 o&rsquo;clock, so I had to excuse myself to have lunch and go ahead.</p>
<p>I went up to the third floor again, which was similar to the second floor. There was no lens I wanted in the product manual. The bosses of several stores called a person, who was probably an agent of Zeiss lenses, and said that the lenses I wanted were not available. It is necessary to find the manufacturer to transfer the goods. I walked into another store at random. The owner of this store was a young man who spoke more frankly. I think he seems to be familiar with photochromic lenses. He gave me a 30% off on the price of the lenses, about 1,100 yuan. I took out my mobile phone and showed him the price of the lenses in Jingdong’s shopping cart. I also told him that I just saw a company that can sell lenses and frames for 1,000 yuan. He said yes quickly, faster than I thought. After that, I began to choose the frame and probably selected a few. I confirmed the model specification and price of the lens with him again, with no problem. He also said that the customized lenses would take 5 to 7 days to get. I was hesitating between photochromic lenses and regular lenses. I excused myself to have lunch before thinking about it because I was hungry.</p>
<p>I went to the fourth floor again, and the situation was similar, and the prices given were higher. I decided to go to the store on the third floor. I walked around for half an hour and came back to the store. I picked out a few more frames and confirmed the model specifications and prices of the lenses with the boss. I paid the money and added the boss&rsquo;s WeChat account, and he will notify me when the glasses are finished. I went down to the first floor, and it was just after noon. I bought a train ticket from Beijing North Railway Station to Huairou North Railway Station at 4:30 pm. I think there is more time, so I want to change the ticket to the 2:30 pm train. But it cannot be changed when it is full. I started thinking about how I would pass the few hours in between, and I decided to go eat first.</p>
<p>It is too expensive to eat in Beijing. A bowl of noodles in a small roadside shop costs 20 yuan, and there is no meat in it. I went all the way north along the road and found a McDonald&rsquo;s. Compared with other restaurants, I think McDonald&rsquo;s is good, the price is acceptable, you can eat real meat, the taste is also good, don&rsquo;t worry about food safety, especially the &ldquo;SuiXinPei&rdquo; package, 13.9 yuan can buy a double cheeseburger and Pineapple pie, although the price is higher than before. I found a seat at McDonald&rsquo;s and continued to think about where to go after the launch. I decided to cycle from here to Beijing North Railway Station so that I could see the street scenes along the way and pass the time.</p>
<p>When I got out of McDonald&rsquo;s, I found a Hello bike. I bought a monthly pass before, and it was free for two hours. It took an hour and a half from the East Third Ring Road to Chang&rsquo;an Avenue to the North Second Ring Road. There were dozens of minutes left to arrive at the North Station, so I went for a casual stroll in the nearby CapitaMall, then got on the train and returned to school.</p>

</div>
<p>After a week, my glasses were ready. I made an appointment for the shuttle bus at 7:00 am on Saturday and bought a train ticket for 2:30 pm.</p>
<p>Like last time, we arrived at the Olympic Village drop-off point before 8:00. It was still early, so I went to the Olympic Park first, and there were very few people inside.</p>
<div align="center">
<a class="lightgallery" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/kayak4665664/My-images/IMG_2470.jpeg" data-thumbnail="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/kayak4665664/My-images/IMG_2470.jpeg" data-sub-html="<h2>Olympic Park</h2>"></a>
</div>
<p>After that, I took the subway to Panjiayuan and arrived at about 9:00. When I went up to the third floor, I found that I couldn&rsquo;t find where the store was, so I went around to find it. I got the glasses, checked them out, checked the authenticity of the lenses, and found nothing wrong. I walked out of the building and sure enough, the glasses changed color, which felt good.</p>
<div align="center">
<a class="lightgallery" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/kayak4665664/My-images/IMG_2543.JPG" data-thumbnail="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/kayak4665664/My-images/IMG_2543.JPG" data-sub-html="<h2>my glasses</h2>"></a>
</div>
<p>I had breakfast at 6 am and was already hungry. I walked to that McDonald&rsquo;s again, but it was just after 10 o&rsquo;clock, and it was still selling breakfast. I sat down and rested for half an hour.</p>
<p>After launch, I started to wander in the direction of Beijing North Railway Station, taking the subway for a while and walking for a while.</p>
<div align="center">
<a class="lightgallery" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/kayak4665664/My-images/IMG_2475.jpeg" data-thumbnail="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/kayak4665664/My-images/IMG_2475.jpeg" data-sub-html="<h2>Forbidden City</h2>"></a>
</div>
<p>There were dozens of minutes before I arrived at the North Railway Station. I went to the Capita Mall next to the station for a stroll. I went to Mi Home and took a look at the latest products of Xiaomi. Then got on the train and went back to school.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the water in Panjiayuan is really deep and there are many pits, but it has a price advantage. If you are not short of money, it is a better choice to go to a large chain store like Baodao Glasses, with better service and less worry. The paired glasses this time are more in line with my expectations and I am quite satisfied.</p>]]></description>

      </div><p>Delicious Creamy Fruit Cake!</p>
<p>Based on <a href="https://www.kayak4665664.com/tags/cake/"target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">two cakes<i class="fa-solid fa-external-link-alt fa-fw fa-xs ms-1 text-secondary" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> last year, this time added cream and fruit and put a few Oreos. The taste was more varied. The only downside was that the cake base was not sweet and soft enough. It tasted a bit like mantou(Chinese steamed bun)😂.</p>]]></description>
