<p>Now that I have completed most of the work on my graduation project, these last two weeks have been relatively relax. But I am now quarantined and can only stay in the room every day🙃, and today is the 4th day.</p>
<p>At noon on May 27, I went to the canteen to have lunch as usual. As soon as I returned to my dormitory, I suddenly received a notice from the school asking graduates to leave the school as soon as possible. I realized right away that this would be my last few days at North China University of Technology.</p>

<p>I calmed down a bit and immediately started planning what I had to do before I left school. The first thing to consider is my luggage. Fortunately, the school promised that it can be delivered for free. Otherwise, I can&rsquo;t afford the cost of expressing so many things. However, I didn&rsquo;t have a cardboard box for packing. I asked the counselor and he only said it would be released later. I felt his answer was too vague, and I decided to go buy a few cardboard boxes myself. I went to the school express outlet and found the boss there. He told me that our college had taken more than 100 cardboard boxes from him before. I estimated that a student should only get 1 cardboard box. So, I bought 4 large cardboard boxes from the boss for ¥45.</p>
<p>With the cardboard box, I went back to my dormitory to pack the luggage. At the same time, I had to report to the community where my family live. I contacted the staff in the community and she told me that I would be quarantined for 7 days and then quarantined at home for 7 days. I did&rsquo;t think this is reasonable. I have took dozens of nucleic acid tests during school, and they have never been positive, and the school has always been closed. People outside the school can&rsquo;t come in, and people inside the school can&rsquo;t get out. I don&rsquo;t think I should be quarantined for 7 days. And as far as I know, there are some places that do not require centralized quarantine for students returning from Beijing. I explained it to her, but it didn&rsquo;t work. Fortunately, centralized quarantine is free, otherwise it will cost a lot of money. In those days, I saw news that some college students were quarantined after returning home and charged ¥500 a day.</p>
<p>After packing my luggage, I felt a little hot and I noticed that my hair was a little longer. As soon as I thought that I was going to be quarantined for half a month, I went to the barber shop to cut my hair short.</p>
<p>In the evening, the counselor finally informed us that we could go get the cardboard box, and I got a cardboard box and a sack. With the 4 large cardboard boxes I bought, it was just right.</p>
<p>On the morning of May 28, I went to the supermarket to buy a marker and I had to mark my address on the box. I walked into the dormitory building, and a dormitory administrator who was familiar with me told me that I could take my luggage to the express outlet now, and reminded me to hurry up. Considering that I have to move 4 cartons and 1 sack from the dormitory to the outlet, it is not easy to rely on only two hands, so I went to the outlet and borrowed a flatbed trolley from the boss. I went back to my dormitory, marked all 5 items with my information, put them all on the trolley, and all of them were shipped to the express outlet at once.</p>
<div align="center">

<p>Since the notice of the graduates leaving the school was rushed, the boss of the express outlet frankly said that they did not know how to handle the luggage of so many students, and there were only two people in the entire outlet including him. When I pushed the flat trolley to the outlet, I saw that there were already many boxes piled up outside. I was a little worried that so many boxes would be confused, so I asked the boss to affix notes to my luggage first, so that I could also track it easily. By the time I had dealt with all this, it was already past 12 o&rsquo;clock. When I arrived at the canteen, I bought a large plate of Jiaozi. I have to say that it is really delicious, with a lot of meat in it.</p>

<p>At night, I tracked that my luggage had been sent out, and I felt that they were really efficient.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of May 29, the boss suddenly called me. What I was worried about had happened. He said that they made the wrong notes and sent a box of other people&rsquo;s luggage to my address, and my box is still in the outlet😱. I hurried to the outlet again, and one of my boxes was still lying on the shelf.</p>
<p>On May 30, there is nothing special on this day, everything has been dealt with.</p>
<p>On May 31, I woke up before the alarm went off, my last day at school. Get up for breakfast. After that, I started packing sheets, quilts, pillows and my suitcase. I had to bring enough daily necessities, and I was going to be quarantined at night. I packed the bedding into the little cardboard box released by the college, and it just fit inside. I took the box to the outlet, the door was open but no one was there. After waiting for half an hour, the boss finally came.</p>
<p>At noon, I went to the canteen for lunch, which was my last meal at school.</p>
<p>I went back to my dormitory and lay on the mattress. This mattress is too big to be expressed, so I left it here.</p>
<p>At about 3pm, I packed my suitcase, closed the windows, turned off the electric breaker switch, took a last look at my dormitory, and locked the door. I went downstairs to the dormitory administrator and returned my key.</p>
<p>And then I left school and probably never went back.</p>

<p>The photo above was taken on the 31st. On the afternoon of the 30th, I saw someone playing with these signs, but it was still 2021 at that time.</p>
<p>After leaving school, I took the subway to the train station.</p>
<p>At about 8pm, I got off the train. Soon, someone started to check the traveler&rsquo;s place of departure. I was leaving from Beijing and needed to be sent to a quarantine hotel.</p>
<p>After I filled out a document, my ID was seized. They said they would give it back to me. I don&rsquo;t know who they are, but I think their behavior violates the Resident Identity Card Law of the People&rsquo;s Republic of China. After that, there was a long wait, standing for more than 2 hours, and no one came to deal with it. Overall, it was an unpleasant experience.</p>
<p>At about 10pm, someone finally came to meet us, and finally returned my ID card to me. Then we took nucleic acid tests.</p>
<p>Our group got into the car and finally arrived at the quarantine hotel around 11pm. Another long wait, I was already sleepy and exhausted. After another nucleic acid test, I finally entered the room. After the bed was made, it was nearly 1:00 on June 1st.</p>
<p>To be honest, the environment of the hotel is not bad, I can eat and drink on time, and I have had a good time in the past 4 days.</p>
<p>There are still 3 days of centralized quarantine that will end, and 7 days of home quarantine will begin. During this period, the final defense will be held on June 9.</p>
<p>Time flies so fast. When I went back to school on March 15, it was still snowing in Beijing. In a blink of an eye, I suddenly went home again. My 4 years of university life are coming to an end soon, and I will always remember the 4 years at North China University of Technology.</p></div><div class="post-footer" id="post-footer">
