Hello, this is Bing. Kerberos is an authentication system that allows you to securely access various services on the network. Kerberos in Mac is based on the MIT Kerberos implementation and provides Kerberos v5 and v4 protocols, GSSAPI, a graphical authentication interface and a ticket cache. You can use the command line or the Ticket Viewer app to manage your Kerberos tickets.

It seems that this Kerberos is included in macOS, it is located in `/System/Library/CoreServices/Applications/Ticket Viewer.app`, and it is not a malicious program.
