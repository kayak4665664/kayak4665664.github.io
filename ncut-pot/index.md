# NCUT-Pot

**NCUT-Pot** is my graduation project, it&#39;s a honeypot.
&lt;!--more--&gt;

This honeypot supports `Telnet` and `SSH` two protocols, simulates the `Linux` system, and stores hackers&#39; data in the `SQL` database. In addition, it also sends alerts to users via SMS and email. Users can customize commands and directories.
