# KeyboardHolder: Automatically Switch Input Methods

Since I need to use both Chinese and English input methods at the same time, I often switch between Chinese and English. Sometimes I open Terminal and input Chinese. So I found a tool called KeyboardHolder, which can help us automatically switch input methods.

You can also install it with Homebrew: `brew install --cask keyboardholder`.

It can set the input method for each app when it starts or switches from the background to the foreground, such as setting the English input method when Terminal starts.

In addition, it can display the input method switch prompt at the location of the mouse, so you don't need to transfer the focus to the menu bar to check the input method status.
