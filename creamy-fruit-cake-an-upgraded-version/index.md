# Creamy Fruit Cake -- An Upgraded Version🍰

Delicious Creamy Fruit Cake!
&lt;!--more--&gt;
Based on [two cakes](https://www.kayak4665664.com/tags/cake/) last year, this time added cream and fruit and put a few Oreos. The taste was more varied. The only downside was that the cake base was not sweet and soft enough. It tasted a bit like mantou(Chinese steamed bun)😂.
