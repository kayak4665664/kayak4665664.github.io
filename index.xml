<p>Android can directly download the APK and install it; iOS can be downloaded in non-Chinese regions App Store, or a beta version can be downloaded.</p>
<h2 id="apply-for-a-virtual-card">Apply for a virtual card</h2>
<p>After entering the Depay App, click Apply for a card. At the beginning, you can choose a standard card and a Lite card. The Lite card does not require KYC. Now there are 5 types of cards (Lite, Standard, Premium, Platinum, Black Gold). The difference is mainly in the card opening fee, monthly fee and recharge fee. The standard card opening fee is 0, the specific difference can be found on the <a href="https://depay.one/en-us/rights.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">official website</a>.</p>
<h2 id="deposit-convert-usd-recharge-and-activate">Deposit, convert USD, recharge and activate</h2>
<p>Depay currently supports charging USDT (TRC20), at least 5 USDT at a time. USDT can be exchanged for USD in real time after deposit. To activate the virtual card, you need to recharge the card with US dollars. There will be a certain percentage of handling fee for the recharging. The handling fee for the standard card is at least 1 US dollar each time, so do not recharge frequently in small amounts.</p>
<p>After activation, you can view the card number and CVV security code.</p>
<h2 id="black-gold-card">Black Gold Card</h2>
<p>At present, as long as you invite 20 people to open a card, you can ask the administrator to upgrade the black gold card. The black gold card has no monthly fee, and the recharge fee is relatively low.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>Since joining <a href="https://www.bing.com/new" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">waitlist</a> on February 11th, I finally received an email today that I can use the new Bing.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t wait to open Edge Dev and enter CHAT, but I soon found that I couldn&rsquo;t input all the characters normally in the input box. I tried it again in Safari and it worked perfectly, so there is probably something wrong with Edge Dev.</p>
<p>After a few rounds of conversations with the new Bing, it felt like it was a bit lacking in conversational enthusiasm, often asking me to change the subject. Moreover, the prompt ‚ÄúThis has been lovely, but you‚Äôve reached your daily limit. Chat again tomorrow?‚Äù appeared within a few minutes.</p>
<p>I have to say that a very useful feature of the new Bing is that it can obtain information from the web pages and documents we are reading. I tested it, I opened a local PDF file with Edge Dev, clicked the Discover button to chat, and the new Bing can summarize the main points in this file. In addition, it can also easily generate some text in Discover.</p>
<p>According to my experience, I think the new Bing is really good, and I am very much looking forward to the official version in the future.</p>]]></description>

<p>On the basis of <a href="https://www.kayak4665664.com/tags/cake/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">two cakes</a> last year, this time added cream and fruit, and put a few Oreos. The taste was more varied. The only downside was that the cake base was not sweet and soft enough. It tasted a bit like mantou(Chinese steamed bun)üòÇ</p>]]></description>

    <title>Visited Lite: mark all visited links as custom color</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/15173-visited-lite" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Visited Lite</a> is a userscript to customize the color of visited links.</p>
<p>A few days ago, Microsoft launched new versions of Bing and Edge browsers combined with GPT. I read their introductions on the Internet and felt they&rsquo;re really good. And last year I experienced <a href="https://chat.openai.com/chat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">ChatGPT</a> for the first time, so this time I am looking forward to the new version of Bing and Edge, and applied to join <a href="https://www.bing.com/new" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">waitlist</a>.</p>
<p>In the process of using Bing, I suddenly discovered a problem. In Bing&rsquo;s search results, the visited links and unvisited links were both purple, it&rsquo;s difficult to distinguish which links are visited and which are not. I have been using Google before, the unvisited links are blue, and the visited links are purple.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t find the relevant settings in Bing and I didn&rsquo;t know where the problem was. So I looked for some userscripts or browser extensions to solve this problem. I found <a href="https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/15173-visited-lite" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Visited Lite</a>, which can customize the color of visited links for all websites, not just Bing&rsquo;s. I installed this userscript in Edge&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.tampermonkey.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Tampermonkey</a> extension. <a href="https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/15173-visited-lite" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Visited Lite</a> marks all visited links with bold color. However, some web pages may not need this function, and they can be excluded in the <a href="https://www.tampermonkey.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Tampermonkey</a> extension.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I used the texliveonfly package and got <code>env: python: No Such File or Directory</code> directly.</p>
<p>I tried to execute <code>python</code>, and a prompt from Xcode Command Line Tools popped up, saying that I needed to download something, and it downloaded Python3.9, while I already had Python3.8üôÉ.</p>
<p>I tried to create a symbolic link with <code>ln</code>, but it didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>I thought since texliveonfly was written in Python, I could edit it directly. So I found <code>/Library/TeX/texbin/texliveonfly</code> and changed the first line of this file from <code>#!/usr/bin/env python</code> to <code>#!/usr/bin/env python3</code>, which solved the problem.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/plus-one/description/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">LeetCode 66.Plus One</a>, a easy problem. I just want to practice Java, it&rsquo;s been a long time since I wrote Java.</p>
<p>My idea is to traverse from the end to the beginning, if the current digit is 9, then carry, if not, then add 1, and then return the result. If the last digit is 9, then we need to add a 1 at the beginning, at this time we need to create a new array, and then copy the original array.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>The first semester at UCAS passed quickly, and I feel that the experience of this semester is very rich.</p>
<p>I arrived in Huaibei Town, Huairou District, Beijing on August 17, 2022. I visited Yanqi Lake in the afternoon. Yanqi Lake is a very big lake. There are many treesüå≥ by the lake, many boatsüõ∂ on the lake, and many people by the lake. There is also a trail leading to somewhere on the mountain by the lake. I walked on this road for a long time and felt good. Unfortunately, the road was interrupted due to constructionüöß. Later, I learned about this road and the viewing platform of UCAS is connected. I saw a lot of birdsüê¶ on the mountain by the lake. They flew on the lake and chirped on the trees by the lake.</p>

<p>After staying in a farmhouse inn in the village next to Yanqi Lake for one night, I went to UCAS early the next morning. It rainedüåßÔ∏è all day, my clothes and shoes were soaked, but when I first arrived at school, everything felt so fresh and I was in a good moodüôÇ.</p>

<p>With the nucleic acid test every two days, this semester started. The quality and difficulty of the courses offered by UCAS are indeed higher than those offered by NCUT, and I feel that I have gained more. In addition to class, I often ride a bicycleüö≤ around the school to see the scenery of the campus. Because the school is backed by mountains and Yanqi Lake, the ecological environment of the school is very good. There are often little animalsüê±, and it is said that there are beast of prey such as boarsüêó and snakesüêç.</p>

<p>I have to say that UCAS has planted many fruit trees in the mountains. After the autumn harvest, we ate a lot of free fruits.</p>

<p>At the end of November, the school became not so peaceful. As the Omicron epidemic became more serious in winter, many colleges and universities in Beijing began to arrange for students to return home. In the beginning, UCAS still required students to complete all the exams at school, and then finally allowed students to return to their hometowns on November 29. All kinds of gossip spread in the school for a while: some people said that there was a student who tested positive for nucleic acid in the school, and all the students could not go home, and they might be quarantined in the dormitory; someone said that after leaving the school and entering the urban area of Beijing, someone would search the mobile phone at the train station or other places&hellip; It feels a bit panicky.</p>
<p>Since the city where my family is located was under lockdown, I didn&rsquo;t know when it would end, so I decided to stay in school. It is said that if there is an epidemic on campus, the cafeteria may not be able to cook normally, so I quickly stocked up some food. At that time, many express delivery services were interrupted, and JD Express also became very slow.</p>
<p>During those few days, most of the students left the school and went home, and the school was quiet. Around December 5, there was a sudden major change in the epidemic prevention policy, and the nucleic acid test every two days was finally ended. But at this time, infected people began to appear in the school, and I also prepared 2 boxes of compound acetaminophen capsules.</p>
<p>After waking up on the morning of December 19th, I felt my throat was dry and a little sore, and there was a lot of nasal discharge. I must have an infection. That night, my sports watch kept warning me my heartü´Ä was beating very fast at around 120BMP. I could hear my heart beating while sitting quietly. I was so scared and I lay down on the bed. My whole body was hot, and my heart rate still couldn&rsquo;t drop. With the sound of my heart beating, I finally fell asleep. Checking the records the next morning, the heart rate slowly dropped to around 90BMP, which is very abnormal.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know what was wrong with this, since it came out in 2019, I didn&rsquo;t know that the new crown virus could affect the heart. I searched on the Internet, and many people have encountered the same situation as me. It is said that it is viral myocarditis. So I quickly placed an order for coenzyme $Q_{10}$ capsules.</p>
<p>On December 22, I went to pick up an antigen detection reagent, and I was indeed infected with the new coronavirusü¶†.</p>

<p>After a week, my symptoms gradually disappeared, but I still had some cough and my heart rate was still fast. On December 27, I picked up another antigen test reagent, which was negative this time.</p>
<p>After more than a week, I finished all the exams, my heart rate was still not normal, so I decided to go to Huairou Hospital for a checkup. I did heart color Doppler ultrasound, chest CT scan and multiple blood tests, and the test results showed no abnormalities. The doctor said that my condition should be the sequelae of the new crown rather than myocarditis, and it would take a long time to recover.</p>
<p>It is already 2023, I just hope that we can resume our life before the epidemic as soon as possibleüôè.</p>]]></description>
