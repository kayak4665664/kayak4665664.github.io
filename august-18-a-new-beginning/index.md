# August 18, a New Beginning

Since the end of the graduation project, I have been looking forward to the letter of admission every day, and it is finally here!
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

Haha, the campus card is here too. I&#39;m very much looking forward to the new semester at UCAS, but I have to report on August 18, and I&#39;m going to the driving school. I feel that my vacation has ended before it even startedðŸ¥¹

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

I also received my graduation certificate and degree certificate. I miss those happy days at NCUT.
