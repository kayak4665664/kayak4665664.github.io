Haha, the campus card is here too. I'm very much looking forward to the new semester of UCAS, but I have to report on August 18, and I'm going to the driving school. I feel that my vacation has ended before it even startedðŸ¥¹

I also received my graduation certificate and degree certificate. I miss those happy days at NCUT.
