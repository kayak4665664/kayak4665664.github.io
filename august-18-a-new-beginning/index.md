# August 18, a New Beginning

Since the end of the graduation project, I have been looking forward to the letter of admission every day, and it is finally here!

Haha, the campus card is here too. I'm very much looking forward to the new semester at UCAS, but I have to report on August 18, and I'm going to the driving school. I feel that my vacation has ended before it even startedðŸ¥¹

I also received my graduation certificate and degree certificate. I miss those happy days at NCUT.
