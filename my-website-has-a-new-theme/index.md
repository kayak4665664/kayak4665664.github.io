# My Website Has a New Theme

I have been using the [LoveIt](https://github.com/dillonzq/LoveIt) Hugo theme since I built my website in 2021, and not much has changed. This time, I migrated to the [FixIt](https://github.com/hugo-fixit/FixIt) theme, which not only fixed some problems in LoveIt, but also brought more new features and optimizations. By the way, the comment system has migrated from [Valine](https://valine.js.org/) to [Waline](https://waline.js.org/).

Since FixIt is based on LoveIt, migrating to Fixit is relatively easy. After some tweaking, the main changes to my website are as follows:

1. Enable Twemoji
2. Migrate the comment system from Valine to Waline, add image and gif, article reactions, etc.
3. Add Font Awesome icons to the menu bar
4. Add Github corner
5. Change Mapbox map style
6. Add donation function
7. Add PWA support
8. Add website creation time display
9. Add BuSuanzi visit statistics
10. Add website word count
11. Change tags to word cloud display
12. Add PangguZhibai
13. Add page watermark
14. Add reading progress bar
15. Add page loading progress bar

Now FixIt is still continuously and actively updating, and I will continue to follow up and continuously improve my website.
